After going to the CFA Home Office Backstage Tour and finding out the original restaurant was only 10 minutes away, we had to complete our \"CFA Day\" with lunch here. It just happened to be that Bubba Cathy, one of Truett's sons and SVP of CFA, was there and introduced himself as we were waiting in line for a seat! We recognized him having just seen him on the video we were shown on the tour. He was there for lunch with some people himself, so it was cool to see. \n\nOur waitress was Victoria who had worked there for 16+ years and she was soooo sweet, constantly asking us how we were doing, apologizing for keeping us waiting because she was waiting on Bubba, and when we said we understood because she was waiting on the big boss, she said she treats us all the same. Before we left she told us some stories about growing up with the Cathy family and I was enamored with the pride that she had for them and her place of employment. \n\nAnyway foodwise, get the hot brown, and just enjoy the fact that you're eating at the place where it all began.  Also it's open 24 hours (except Sunday of course!) and close to the airport so stop by if you can."},

I was very excited to get a chance to eat here & go back to tell my friends all about it. my first time here the service was pretty slow & that was due to the lack of employees out on the floor. the waitress was sweet and did the best that she could,but everything didn't come out hot which is annoying because no one comes out to pay for cold food. but i tipped anyway because she was a pleasure. So today was my second time back & yet again not enough employee's working on the floor, my food was cold yet again. the only thing hot was the mac&chesse sweet potatoes & greens. but my waffle & chicken wasn't the food is good enough for me to keep coming back but just get some more workers on the floor. Most of the workers look tired & overworked. The food not being hot & the lack of workers bought your rate to 3 stars sadly because the food is a 5 star all day even cold so if the problems were fixed i will gladly leave a better review."},

But today someone destroyed my perfect track record after 30 + years! \n\nI am still 38 hot over here in Hapeville right now! Not only were the fries cold but after we each asked for specific condiments like BBQ sauce, Ketchup and Mayo and looking in the bag and saying that it wasn't enough for all three meals. We were told \"Yes it is. I gave you two of everything that you asked for per meal!\". Now that was an issue for me because I don't use Mayo , so as I was trying to explain to this young lady that I don't need Mayo when she actually sighed as if we were wasting her time or getting on her nerves. All I could do is think \"This heifer!\" as I sat in my co-workers car. \n\nIf I had been driving then we might still be there because the condiment bag looked a little light for 24 packets of condiments. Any who. Once we got back to the office we all noticed that we had cold waffle fries, only two packets of ketchup, two packets of Mayo, two packets of BBQ sauce and two packets of Honey BBQ sauce. Now the sandwiches were warm and the beverages were right but cold/hard fries and no condiments totally messes up a meal for me. I could have gotten us three Hot Dog combos from Sam's today for $1.50 and have added three pretzels for a fraction of the cost of these $20 worth of meals.\n\nNot only that, but the cashier according to the receipt is Florence.  Well Ms. Florence, whom was standing there with her arms folded as if we needed to hurry along might need to get a job over at McDonald's cause we can't have this nonsense at Chick-fil-A.  And my co-worker said she didn't say \"It was my pleasure serving you!\", did she? The answer is NO. \"No she damn didn't!\".

History is another: this is the birthplace of Chick-fil-A.  Were this Dwarf House's only asset, it would not deserve a place in the pantheon of Atlanta eateries.  But if you have only a few hours between flights, and can afford a cab to the nearby community of Hapeville, the best way to experience Atlanta's warm welcome is to place yourself in the care of Tammy and her co-workers.\n\nIf you really are a dwarf, or if you're a child, Dwarf House has an entrance just for you.  I stooped through it as a joke, but it's a functioning entryway and a testament to the difference between Dwarf House and any other Chick-fil-A location on Earth.  Here's one more difference:\n\nYou can be served on Sunday at Dwarf House.  Sort of.  If you're up early enough, or late enough, you can visit before 4am on the Lord's day and still get your fix of sweet tea or deep-fried peach pie.  After 4am, Dwarf House remains closed until midnight makes it Monday again -- after which they're open 24 hours a day until 4am Sunday.\n\nTammy, our server, is the very soul of Southern hospitality.  We were truly her GUESTS, and she would have it no other way.  She was unfailingly courteous, welcoming, happy to explain or recommend menu items, happy to discuss the history of Dwarf House, and under no circumstances did she ever let our glasses become half-full without offering a refill.  On the other hand, we felt that we had the conversation to ourselves.  Tammy has perfected the art of watching like a mother hen (you should pardon the analogy) without hovering.  I can honestly say that being Tammy's guest was among the finest examples of hospitality which it has ever been my pleasure to experience.  I can't bring myself to call it great \"customer service\" because, in my opinion, \"customer service\" is what companies offer in lieu of hospitality.  Tammy's hospitality is the real deal.\n\nI had a baked potato with cheese and smothered (grilled) onions, and let me tell you, the 30 cents I was charged for the onions wouldn't even buy that much onion at a store.  It was enough to cover the potato even after I splayed it out, dissection-style, on the plate.  That should give you some idea of the quantity and price.\n\nI also had a side salad, another good value.  Chunks of broccoli accompanied tiny sweet grape tomatoes on top, and the Truett's House dressing (a French-style dressing, with pickle juice as the third ingredient) was a refreshing change from ranch, blue cheese, and vinaigrette.  A packet of sunflower seeds and a packet of croutons made the salad better than I felt I had a right to expect for only around two dollars.\n\nIf you'd like to be Tammy's guest -- and who, janitor or monarch, wouldn't? -- she's currently working afternoons and nights, from 2pm to 10pm.  Stop in and see what real Southern hospitality can be."},

Since we've been to the fast food area tons of time, we sat at the counter and started chatting with Tricia, who was taking care of all the guests there. She instantly took a liking to us and gave us the scoop on the menu, including a sample of their white chicken chili complete with tortilla stripes and sour cream (very tasty but I did not go to the dwarf house for soup!)\n\nWhile perusing this fabulous site. I kept seeing people mention an item called the Hot Brown.  They have the regular items you can find on any Chick Fil A menu and then some including BLT's, mac n cheese, sweet potato souffle and a number of breakfast items. But for some reason the item Hot Brown stuck in my head.

As soon as I got one bite with all of the items in one, I knew I was toast (pun intended) and it wouldn't be long before it was finished. Hell, I even finished the fried cheese stuck to the plate. It was that amazing.....and that worth it! Would I be willing to eat here every day if I lived in the area? Hell no, only because I don't want a coronary any time soon.\n\nWe were sure to leave from the little red dwarf door in the front of the restaurant, ahhh, to live like a dwarf!"},

Love the fact that the menu goes beyond what I have come to know from Chick-fil-A and love that everyone, even other patrons are so nice and friendly. I ventured off and got the steak sandwich with straight fries, I wouldn't recommend the steak sandwich, but I would recommend the fries. My buddy kept it pretty standard with nuggets, a char-grilled on wheat, fries and took his chances with a bowl of chili. I was busy chatting (it's what I do best) and by the time I turned around the chili had vanished. He said it was pretty awesome and he'll be returning again for another bowl.

They have an expanded menu and serve things like Chicken and Waffles, Scrambled eggs and hashbrowns, omelettes, regular biscuits and bacon, etc. in addition to Chick Fil A menu items. The difference here is that they bring it to you like you are dining in a restaurant(regular thick plates, fresh coffee where they will pour if for you, etc). \n\nThe service was what I expected: fast and friendly as always. It took maybe 3-5 minutes for my waitress to come by and get my order after I sat down, and maybe 5-10 minutes for all the food, if that. \n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles plate with a side of hashbrowns and also fruit.

I come here just about every other day whether it be the drive-thru or dine in. I could seriously go on and on about this place. Instead, I'll give a summarized list of the joys this place has to offer. \n\n1. Prompt service. No matter how long the drive-thru is, you can guarantee the employees are working their hardest to get you through in a timely manner. \n\n2. The employees. The service is unmatched. When you're dining in, you're likely to get an older waitress/waiter that cares so much about you and your order. They take your order with care, the cook cooks it like he's cooking for his own family, and he gives you the portion size he would give himself. (No seriously, order an omelet.)\n\n3. The menu. Unlike the other locations you're not limited to fries, salad, yogurt and fruit as your side item. They have fried okra, Mac and cheese, green beans, collard greens, cornbread, and sweet potato souffl\u00e9. All delicious. \n\n4. The place itself. It's 24 hours 6 days a week! Who doesn't want Chic-fil-a or their delicious (always working machine) ice cream at 2am? Andddd you get to decide. Are you in a hurry? Breeze through the drive-thru and order the regular menu. Have a little time? Sit down and try their chicken and waffle combo, or the omelet, or the infamous \"Hot Brown\". \n\nIt's truly just an humble refreshment in the Hapeville community."},

Well I flew in on airtran ( making delta unnecessary) and went in the world of coke gift store ( not to mention drank my fair share of diet coke this weekend), so all that was left was to go to chick fil a.  Since we were running kind of early, thanks to my anal need to be at airports early, we opted to stop off the highway rather than wait until the airport.\n\nWell this was also my first chick fil a experience ever. When we pulled up it was amazing how many lights and TVs were there. It was like the disneyworld of fast food!  We opted not to go inside but instead went through the drive through.   It was at this point we kept remarking how amazingly well lit and \"fun\" looking the place was and kathleen pointed out \"well it iis the original one\".  I think that its only fitting my first experience was at the originial chick fil a.\n\nThe menu was slightly overwhelming since i really didn't know what i wanted.  Jeff kept saying 'the food is suprisingly healthy for you\".   I'm sure that my #1 (fried chicken biscuit w/ hashbrowns) was far from being healthy.... but man did it taste awesome!  The biscuit was buttery and delicious and the chicken was perfectly fried.  The only down part was the hash browns which were cute, but just not that good.    \n\nThe best part about this final stop on my atlanta vacation.... i can revisit it any time i want with the many chick fil a locations in the NoVA area :)"},

What?! This had to be made up! But Wikipedia and Google promptly confirmed that indeed, Chick Fil-A has its origins in this so-called \"Dwarf House\" in Hapeville, Georgia. The Dwarf House is still a full service diner open 24/6 - like all Chick Fil-A restaurants, closed on Sundays. And everything I see on the internet about this place indicates to me that I ABSOLUTELY MUST GO.\n\nI did this morning - it's about a mile off of 75 south of the city. From the front, the little red dwarf door looked sort of like it was locked, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not. My friend and I walked through it with glee. We pointed and giggled at the moving wall display of seven dwarfs exiting their house and trotting off to the mines. We looked at the photographs of the Dwarf House through the years. We read the story of its founding in the captions. \n\nMy friend and I seemed to be the only ones delighting in the dwarfiness, however. The rest of the clientele appeared to be regulars or locals for whom any dwarf-related novelty had long since worn off. They also seemed to leer at us, though my friend noticed this more than I did. \n\nAside from the splashes of German cottage decor, the place looks like the love child of a Chick Fil-A and a down-home diner. It's full service, with booths, barstools, and an overhead dimly illuminated menu with plastic removable lettering. But the colors are decidedly Chick Fil-A, and the place still displays those abhorrent advertisements involving cows that know how to write, but not spell. These cow advertisements, by the way, are my least favorite major advertising campaign that has lasted more than a year, EVER. But don't get me started on that. \n\nWe immediately took our seats at a not-yet wiped down booth, the only one available at 10:14 on a Saturday morning. I was a bit antsy because the menu said that they were going to stop serving biscuits at 10:30. A busboy came by first to clear the previous occupants' dishes. A few minutes later, someone came to take our drink orders. After asking for water, I warned this person that I fully intended to order a biscuit, and she said that would not be a problem. In fact, she said I had forty minutes left, so perhaps the menu is incorrect as to the no more biscuit time? I didn't care, as long as I got mine. \n\nI ordered an egg and cheese biscuit, and hash browns with cheese and onions. The hash browns came out first, and without the onions. The biscuit came out seconds later. My friend ordered the chick fil-a chicken breakfast, which consists of two biscuits, grits, eggs any style, and a boneless piece of battered chicken. The wait time was only minutes. I am not shy about grease, and the food was delightful. The biscuit was slightly crumbly but very moist - Chick Fil-a does biscuits a little differently, and not everyone likes them. I happen to love them. The scrambled egg was not quite as processed and perfectly squared as it is when it comes from a fast-food joint. The cheese was, of course, an American cheese single. Mmmmmm. The hash browns were crispy, all golden brown and dripping in oil, just how I like them. \n\nAfter paying our bill of $11, we exited through the little door again. I stopped to play with the round door knocker on the other side, knocking several times. No answer. I did not have the opportunity to try either a fried apple pie or the \"ice box pie\" in lemon, chocolate, or coconut. But that's next on my list. \n\nSo Chick Fil-A managed to trick me into feeling like I went to this cute local diner for breakfast today, when really I just patronized another fast food giant. Nonetheless, I am definitely going back to Dwarf House at every available opportunity."},

Closer to a Waffle House than a Chick-fil-A but also with dwarf animated decorations and a red dwarf door. \n\nThe sit down portion includes a separate menu including grits, hot brown (casserole dish with chicken, potatoes, gravy, and bacon), and steak (gasp!). I guess the cow marketing tactic only applies to the fast food chain? I had the chicken platter, which is essentially the #1 (Chick-fil-A sandwich with waffle fries) on a plate instead of fast food wrappings. Just as delicious as always.

I decided to go the full-service route (on a barstool since I was alone on business), and am glad I did. One review suggested the regular chicken sandwich was bigger & better than other Chick-Fil-A restaurants, but I disagree. It tasted exactly the same as the ones in Texas, and I actually think the chicken was smaller here. So don't order the standard chicken sandwich if you go there -- get one of the unique items. I wasn't able to find a menu of the unique items online (and the lady on the phone didn't seem interested in giving me a comprehensive list over the phone), so maybe this list will help some of you that are wondering just HOW different the full-service menu is:\n\nLunch/Dinner menu (in addition to normal stuff):\nOne-piece plate, two-piece plate, chargrilled one-piece plate, chargrilled two-piece plate, steak plate, Hot Brown (other reviews describe this), hamburger plate, midnight sandwich (ham & cheese), ham/bacon lettuce tomato sandwich, giant burger, steak sandwich, dwarf burger, grilled cheese sandwich, kids meal.\n\nVegetables:\nfried okra, fried peas, collard greens, mashed potatoes, sweet potato souffle, cornbread, mac & cheese, kernel corn, green beans, broccoli & cheese. Also note they serve \"straight\" fries if you ask for them instead of the traditional waffle fries (I only saw waffle fries on their menu sign but was able to order straight fries).\n\nBreakfast (served all day):\nEggs & toast & grits (bacon, ham, or sausage optional), steak & eggs, Chick-Fil-A chicken & eggs, chicken egg & cheese bagel, waffle, cinnamon cluster, etc.\n\nAnd they have individual slices of pies - some fried and some regular. I had the lemon and it was great (tart but that's how I like it).\n\nI tried the regular chicken sandwich (same as everywhere), dwarf burger (small but perfect when sampling other things too), straight fries (pretty standard fries - medium size sticks -- fatter than other fast food fries), and a small slice of lemon pie (the most enjoyable thing I ordered, which is how it's supposed to work). \n\nI'd love to go back someday and try some of the other unusual items on the menu -- including breakfast!  The nice server at the bar gave me 3 little stuffed cow toys as souvenirs for my 3 young kids back home -- but only when I asked (like other reviews have said). Thanks to the other reviewers for the tips to ask for straight fries and the little cow souvenirs -- I wouldn't have known about either of those otherwise."},

On my visit to Hotlanta I made it a point to visit the original ChickFilA.  Yes, ever.  I think my tourist attitude showed and the guests waiting in front of us struck up a conversation with us giving us some background info.  Built when the Disney dwarves were popular, there is a wall that actually has the seven dwarves moving along the mounted picture frame.  The server we had let us know that when the Cathys' opened up, the city tried to tax them double... they refused saying something about they could go ahead and throw a rock through the window instead?  They weren't going to pay?  Maybe I misheard.  I was too busy eating at that point.\n\nAbout the food: it's normal diner food.  EXCEPT!  Wait, we are at ChickFilA.  And I had a server.  And grits.  And biscuits and gravy.  And a hamburger.  And cheese smothered fries (which I dipped the cheese in everything after I figured out how great it was).  Yeah, exactly!  Am I the only one who finds this fascinating?  Probably.  The food itself is a 3.5 but the novelty of having both a walk up order counter and a sit down diner at my favorite fast food restaurant is awesome to me.\n\nPlus, there is an actual tiny door that is fully operational!  I kid you not, after I was done dorking out with my photos... an actual employee used it as his entrance and exit to do an errand instead of the main door.  \n\nSo back to my \"hearting\" the south, the family we were talking to in the beginning of this review came by our table as we were leaving... let us know that they knew the Cathys personally and even gave us a little eat mor chicken cow.  I guess they must have picked up our check then.  They paid for our bill.  Southron hospitality.  Made my tourist experience that much more memorable.  I may have eaten at some $$$ locations during my visit to the ATL, but this place was by far my favorite."},

Here you can order food for breakfast, lunch and dinner and you are not restricted to just chicken here. Want a hamburger? You can get one. The Chick-Fil-A cows may not like it, but you're the customer. Only downside is that seating is limited here, so if you come during the lunch rush you have to wait a while for an open seat or you end up in the fast-food section of Chick-Fil-A.\n\nSpeaking of lines, they have a dual-lane drive-thru at this location. Even hours before lunch, both lanes fill up with customers quickly. So, get here early if you want prompt, efficient service. Do so, and you'll have a good time.\n\nAlso can't forget about some of the artifacts outside the diner, such as a bench with S.

The staff are friendly and there's many regulars who often visit on a daily basis. I know one of the regulars...a sweet guy who retired from my job. Back to the food...I took my Godfather here after picking him up from the airport for his first Atlanta visit. It was a Friday morning & the place was jumping! They have a well oiled system so don't let the crowd discourage you & miss out. If you go through the drive-tru they often have staff walking-up to cars to electronically take your order & payment. More patience is required if you come inside. We ate at the sit down diner. Once a table is available, just wait your turn & slide in. The breakfast items are basic-nothing fancy. I got 2 eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, biscuit, & added a bowl of grits. Overall, very reasonably priced & friendly environment."},

This location is right around the corner from my house and I've patronized the drive-thru but never got to go inside until this week. \n\nEstablished in 1946, this Chick-Fil-A is cool because it is the ORIGINAL Chick-Fil-A therefore it serves as kind of a mini museum. Besides the life sized statue of Truett Cathy sitting on a bench outside the restaurant, there are photos and plaques on the inside that tell you all about how CFA got its start and how the restaurant actually got its name. You also see pictures of the original building and can compare it to how it looks now. The little red Dwarf door is just the cutest thing ever, am I right?! My wife and I had to crawl through it because...I mean, who could resist? Honorable mention for sheer adorableness: The moving snow white and the seven dwarfs frame picture on the back wall of the restaurant...neat!\n\nThe restaurant was impeccably clean with comfy booths and ample seating but my favorite part of the whole experience was the service! It felt like we were in an ole-timey diner where the wait staff was so super courteous, sweet and attentive and everything out of their mouths was, \"it's my pleasure ma'am.\" I LOVED IT! I saw on Andrea A's review that the servers' length of service is listed on their badges and some of them have been there for 15+ years! Wow I wish I'd known, that's pretty cool. Next time I'll be sure to look out for that. \n\nYou will also find menu items here that you won't find at just any CFA--such as fried okra and carrot-raisin salad. And for dessert apple turnovers and chocolate icebox pie! I tried the carrot raisin salad and it was okayyy but I probably wouldn't order it again--the carrots were pretty mushy. \n\n Overall, this is a very fun location to eat at and every ATLien should visit at least once because it's one of those rare Atlanta gems that just makes you feel like you've had a special experience.\n\n Since we ate here for lunch, I'd love to come back to try breakfast."},

I got something to go the first time I visited from the self service side. Service was REALLY friendly. The second time (I was at ATL for an three hour layover) my friend and I had to wait 10 minutes for a table to free up. There is also counter seating. \n\nI'm not sure if I would love Chickfila as much if I had access to one on a regular basis. I got a plate with eggs, hash browns, chicken, and biscuits with honey on the side. Delicious. I also tried the grilled ham and cheese sandwich... it was good, but unfortunately I did not have enough stomach space to handle it. I loved the coconut ice box pie. Coffee had free refills. They were really busy during the Saturday brunch time so service was a little slow, but the waitress was nice. \n\nOn another visit I tried the fried peach pie... the bag it came in had glorious grease stains. I ended up bringing this home, nuking it, and eating it with a side of vanilla bean ice cream.  \n\nThere is a 'dwarf door' which you can exit from the inside..."},

I think this basically just means it doesn't come with a side salad like it would for lunch or dinner. Hot indeed. I was too excited to take a bite and burned my mouth a little bit. I guess it's basically chicken in a casserole dish with mashed potatoes, gravy, cheese, bacon, and served with toast.

I didn't even notice until halfway through that it didn't come with butter, and I feel like that says a lot for me because I usually can't do pancakes or waffles without butter. The chicken was the same as from the sandwich I think.

(Is Hapeville still a sleepy town now that the Porsche headquarters is there?)

The other side there is a diner counter, retro stools and plush booths so that you can sit down and savor your meal on a plate.  For some reason, the diner side is a magnet for senior citizens, police officers and firefighters.  \n\nAside from the Chick-Fil-A chicken, the food is amazingly average.  The breakfast items (Grits, Eggs, Toast) are all good but in a standard way.  The lunch items Mac and Cheese, Sweet Potato Casserole, Greens) are on par with standard southern cafeteria food.  Everything is tasty and filling even if unimaginative.\n\nI do like the fact that they display the calorie information right on the menu.  I'm there to consume all things buttery and fried but I appreciate having full information.  I'm pretty sure that other diners like being able to make informed decisions too.  \n\nThree stars for the food with a fourth added for service.  Many of the waitresses have been working at this same location for 15+ years; their length of service is on their name tags.  They have southern sweetness on lock.  No matter which one of them serves me I'm almost guaranteed to be called Sweetie, Honey or Sugar at some point.\n\nThe Dwarf House is a good place for a down-home southern meal and courteous service.

In other places, other restaurants I dont complain much but Knowing Chick-Fil-A's standards and expectations from them this was the worst. Chick-fil-A is always one of those places where everything is quick, easy, and the staff always has that Southern Hospitality but this location NO! Even waffle house has better service than this specific location (The Dwarf House) I don't think I would come back."},

The set up is a little different from your regular Chick-fil-A. The parking lot is a maze and tight, so be prepared for that. Upon entering, you can go to the right which is where your typical Chick-fil-A offerings are, along with the typical service. On the left, there is more of a full-serve set-up, with booths along the windows and counter stools near the grill (similar to how Waffle House is laid out). \n\nThe full-service side is complete with fold out menus and servers who are quick. The kitchen staff (which you can watch from your booth or are right in front of you at the counter) push food out incredibly quick. The menu and prices are also displayed along the top of the wall right above the kitchen staff. I noted that the prices at this location are significantly higher than say at standalone Chick-fil-A down the street (i.e. $2.75 for tea lemonade, over $3 for orange juice). The food is great though, with breakfast served all day and with expanded offerings on the breakfast and regular menus. On a Friday morning at about 11:00, we were seated in 20 minutes - several tables appeared done with their meals, but were simply chatting and lounging despite the line going out the door. I got a chicken omelette and scattered potatoes (hashbrowns), and both filled the plate up. The wait time for the sit-down side can be quite long and a bit disorganized, as there was a host taking names, but she also was busing tables - meaning that while she was away, folks were wandering in and bypassing those waiting to be seated. I would recommend stopping by if you're in Hapeville (which is in the middle of nowhere); probably wouldn't make is a regular weekend spot just due to location and the higher prices, but I would come back if in the area."},

The service has declined and the food has become very hit and miss. Today, the Saturday before the Super Bowl in Atlanta, we decided to grab some chicken salad as we passed by. The take out counter was not awfully busy with maybe a half dozen people waiting. And waiting. And waiting. There were six people behind the counter. About as many as there were customers. None of them however seemed to notice that some people hadn't ordered. They ignored them while chatting and cutting up. I finally ordered a cup of chicken salad. A dish that didn't need to be cooked, it only required being removed from a refrigerator and placed in a bag. It took 15 minutes for that to happen. After 12 minutes I got the lady who took my orders attention. I told her I'd like either my chicken salad or my money back. She began to get my money and I said, \"really?  You'd rather give me my money than open that door and hand me a cup of chicken salad?\"  She smirked and went in the back and finally 15 minutes later I got chicken salad."},

But if you really do love Chick-fil-A a lot, are a chicken sandwich addict, want to try items that you can't get anywhere else and have a soft side for their history, then you must make this pilgrimage to Atlanta.\n\nYes, this is THE original location of Chick-fil-A, where what I believe to be the greatest chicken sandwich was ever created. \n\nEverything about this restaurant is different from your typical Chick-fil-A. First, this location is open just about around the clock. They also have servers to provide table service and there are a plethora of non-typical Chick-fil-A items to choose from on their menu. They have various platters, lots of sides, salads, soups, special sides, dessert and breakfast platters. When we went, if I didn't know any better, I would have thought I was in some random diner that just happened to specialize in chicken.\n\nAs a major foodie, I had done my fair share of research prior to coming here so my wife and I thought we knew what was best to get. Every article and review pointed to the Hot Brown as their signature dish, so I went with that. It came with a salad, but who's getting salad at Chick-fil-A? C'mon. I swapped out the salad for waffle fries. My wife ordered the Grilled Chicken Melt Platter with Waffle Fries and Fried Okra. \n\nThe verdict? Meh and meh. Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered. I read the description on the menu and wasn't too excited about the Hot Brown, but I proceeded against my own will anyway. I should have listened to my gut. The Hot Brown was this unappetizing combo of chopped chicken, cream sauce and cheddar cheese. It was a gooey mess in a small tray that pretty much tasted like it sounded. I couldn't get a grip of the flavor of the chicken because the cream sauce and cheese dominated it. The gooeyness of the dish was a turnoff too. My wife wasn't a fan of her chicken melt platter either. It was all very plain and didn't have much flavor to it.\n\nWhen we first walked in, all I could think about was what I typically ordered at Chick-fil-As (nuggets) and why I loved the chain and my word of advice to any customers visiting is DO NOT DIVERT FROM THAT. Go with your gut and the reasons you loved Chick-fil-A in the first place. Don't try to get fancy and order things that just don't sound good, even if it's their \"signature\" dish. You'll enjoy your experience a lot more here. I'm not deterring anyone from trying new things, but in this instance, stick with the chicken you know and love.\n\nBesides the platters we ordered, we both also ordered a Frosted Lemonade, which was something we hadn't seen elsewhere. The best way to describe it was like a creamsicle lemonade shake. It was better than I thought it would be, so that's a win there.\n\nThe service was decent here and quick. I wouldn't say the employees were friendly, but in no way were they hostile either. Most were young and just did their jobs, but didn't go out of their way to converse with customers.\n\nLike I said, coming here won't be for everyone. It's a nice piece of history whenever you go to the 1st of anything that is now global, but if you're just seeking out a Chick-fil-A meal, then it's better to stay local."},

The food here is better than at the regular brick and mortars. \n\nThe fried ocra was seriously the best fried ocra I've ever had. And don't even get me started on the sweet potato souffl\u00e9. I mean, I would be perfectly happy just getting those two sides for dinner. \nI had the chicken salad sandwich. It was pretty good. Not my favorite. But if you like chicken salad it won't offend. \n\nWe also got a tour of the kitchen which was super cool! We actually got to see how the restaurant works. \n\nService was okay. Our server didn't seem to like us very much but that's not a problem. Drink orders were wrong but you know that stuff happens all the time and shouldn't be held against an establishment. \n\nThe bathrooms were okay too. Not the cleanest. But good enough. \nOverall, I definitely recommend if you're a Chick Fil A fan. Food is good. History is neat to experience. Give this place your patronage if you're in the area."},

The yams are actually a mashed sweet potato casserole and if your a food connoisseur like myself you can tell they doused the yams with heavy cream, way too creamy for me. Mac and cheese ,eh.

Not only can you get traditional CFA items, but you can also get Soul food sides like Mac-n-cheese, greens, black eyed peas, cornbread muffins, etc.  I often come here when I am craving sweet potato souffl\u00e9 or Mac n cheese... however, I don't think I have ever left this location without a side of greens. Breakfast is available all day.... and they do have waffles. Hapeville for the win! \n\n**Short Story** \nI brought my family here  when they were visiting from Alabama, and they were excited, but they all turned up their noses at the idea of Mac and cheese from Chick-fil-A. Well my nephew decided to order it.... the poor boy couldn't eat his Mac and cheese because it was being passed around the table! My niece and I went outside to take a few pics of the statue and the Dwarf door, when we came back in, most of the family was in line ordering Mac and cheese to go. \n\n**Ok back to the review** \nThe vibe is more like a diner. However you can order to-go, dine in or go through the drive through as usual. Note: You must go inside to order the Dwarf house sides (well at least you do after a certain time). This location is also open later than normal CFA's. They close around 11:45 most days. \n\nOverall: This location is definitely with the visit."},

As this was on my travel bucket list, we chose the full service option.  The restaurant looked like (in terms of layout and cleanliness) a rundown Waffle House and like, Waffle House, you seat yourself.\n\nOur server looked less than enthused to be there and seemed impatient.  I ordered the Hot Brown (as it's apparently their special and you can't get it at other non-dwarf house Chick-Fil-A restaurants and my boyfriend ordered the steak as you also cannot get it at other non-dwarf house Chick-Fil-A restaurants.  I could hardly finish my Hot Brown as it wasn't good on any level.  It contained pieces of old tasting breaded chicken, smothered in white, chunky goop.

For one, the service was not good. The girl who took our order was not friendly. She didn't smile at all. She was super dry and we thought that maybe she was having a bad day so we tried to make a joke with her and she was not here for it. She continued to look at us crazy and said \"I'm just waiting for you to order\". She proceeded to ring us up, give our total and left the register. Another employee had to come finish the transaction because she started doing other things. I have no idea what the attitude was about. I wish I had gotten her name. It started with a Z and she had blonde and black braids. \n\nThe other issue was the food. It just wasn't good. The fries were cold. The grilled nuggets and classic chicken sandwiches just didn't taste good at all. Overall I wont be back. For that to be the \"original\" it does not give a good representation of the chickfila standard that the company prides themselves for.

Hapeville prides itself on being the home of the original Chick-Fil-A.\n\nI doubt there's anything on their menu I have not had.  Growing up in Hapeville, we either had takeout or dined-in at least once, sometimes twice a week.  In high school, this place was the hangout for us all to meet up after our dates.\n\nThe drive-through options are minimal compared to the dine-in menu, but those with an addiction to Chick-fil-a don't seem to mind.  The place gets so crowded during lunch that a cop has to direct traffic going in and out of the restaurant's parking lot on weekdays.\n\nThe atmosphere is nothing fancy--a diner feel with an animated moving dwarf picture on the back wall showing the seven dwarves going in and out of the coal mine.  As a kid, this intrigued me for hours.  I still get excited when I see the picture--ahhh memories.  Most of the waitresses and managers have been working there for many, many years and know their customers on a first-name and favorite dish basis.  I always like to see the number of years serving on my waitress' name tag--it's usually upwards of 15 years. \n\nSome of my favorites here are the Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich (fried chicken breast between a buttery bun with a few pickles) chicken biscuits, gravy, coleslaw and hot browns.  For dessert--mmmmmmm, the apple pie, peach pie or chocolate icebox pies are great.  They also have the best soft-serve ice cream EVER.  Therefore, their hand-spun milkshakes will make you think you've died and gone to heaven.\n\nIf you come to Atlanta, especially to the airport area, visit the original Chick-fil-a.\n\nI took away one star because their chicken biscuits have gotten smaller over the years.  Other than that, I don't know what I would do without Chick-fil-a, and I think many people can agree."},

Nothing special but definitely a unique/different experience than normal. My real issue was the service. CFA is known for their customer service... so at the ORIGINAL location I feel like the pressure is 10x higher to represent the company. And it 1000% fell short. Our waitress was short with us and not overly friendly. She got our orders wrong. She brought our hot brown out ten minutes after the rest of our food with no apology.

The management of the traffic flow through the parking lot of the hapeville dwarf house is atrocious. I spent over 40 minutes of my day picking up a mobile order. Once in the line, there is no way to get out without going through the whole process. After spending so much time just getting to the window, I had to wait several extra minutes to receive my food because the employees servicing the window acted like a union road construction crew. I was never offered an apology, an explanation, or even an acknowledgment that I had just spent nearly an hour creeping though the drive thru line. There were three employees standing around watching one other employee prepare beverages in the slowest manner I have ever seen. It was like being in the twilight zone. The entire staff seemed completely oblivious to the wait time happening at their store. After I finally received my food, I had to wait an additional two minutes to receive the drinks on my order. I have always been impressed with the professionalism, efficiency, and enthusiasm displayed by chikfila employees I have encountered across the country and was very dismayed at the attitude I saw and the treatment I received visiting this store today. I am shocked that this situation could be allowed within your organization."},

But to big CFA fans like me, this place is such a special gem because it's the ORIGINAL Chick-Fil-A! \n\nI actually came to Atlanta for work and this was the first place I went as soon as my flight landed. As the only crazy person going around this place taking pictures, most people probably thought I was a tad odd. However, I have been going to my local CFAs since I was a kid. In fact, my dad told me that he and my mom ate there all the time when she was pregnant with me...so I've technically been a fan since before I was born! As you can imagine, paying homage to the OG CFA was a must-do on this work trip.\n\nAs some background, this location was originally called The Dwarf Grill and was where S. Truett Cathy got his start in serving customers. It initially only sat 10 people (it was small...hence the somewhat politically incorrect name) but was unique in that it was open 24/7 and served many travelers going in and out of town in the mid 1940s. \n\nWhat's great about this location is that they are still true to their 1940's diner roots, while also incorporating a standard CFA experience. It's essentially two restaurants in one: go to the right and you're in a CFA; Go to the left and you will see booths and a long dining countertop. I am all about that old nostalgic experience, so I opted for the countertop on both of my visits (because yes, I went twice during my stay here...after all, it is very close to the airport!).\n\nThe staff here is very friendly, just like all CFAs. I actually spotted a veteran who had been there 23 years (it was designated on her namebadge). They also work super hard--my second time in, it was a Saturday afternoon and the place was PACKED. The servers were really working hard to ensure everyone was taken care of. \n\nMy first night there, it was a Wednesday around 7p. I was trying to take it all in. However, I was caught off guard when I saw a burger and fries on the menu! So off-brand for Chick-Fil-A! I later saw them cooking a big ole steak in front of me as well! Like I said, they try to pay homage to their old roots and believe it or not, Cathy had beef in his first restaurant! \n\nI decided on Truett's Famous Chick-Fil-A Platter which is essentially a CFA sandwich with two sides. I opted for fries and mac & cheese. It came out in less than five minutes. I love that it comes out on diner style dishes. Makes for such a nostalgic experience! I did ask for Polynesian sauce, which they of course had. That is by far the best of all CFA sauces!\n\nI devoured my sandwich and fries, but left most of the mac & cheese. It was just okay. I should have opted for extra fries. I ended the night with a coconut cream icebox pie! I had been debating between that and the chocolate. It ended up being good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The second time I went, I got the same platter, with fries and cornbread. The cornbread was subpar. Kinda dry. The sandwich and fries were on point though!  I also ordered the chocolate icebox pie. Again, it was okay. To be honest, all it is is pie crust, chocolate pudding filling and whipped cream. For me though, I just tried to envision myself as a weary traveler (which I was just heading to the airport) back in the 1940's, just getting a bite to eat. Then the pie seemed to fit right in! I can just picture these pies spinning in a glass case back in the day as Cathy was serving his customers!\n\nAll in all, if you have any affinity for Chick-Fil-A, this location is worth going out of your way for. I'm so glad I was able to make it there once, let alone twice! What a gem! So amazing to see the growth and success of this company...especially now being able to see where it all started!"},

Ridiculously good.  The chicken quesadilla also never ceases to amaze me with it's cheesy perfection and zesty baja sauce, clearly straight from the gods.

It's on my banned restaurants list. I called it quits the last time I was here and it took me an hour to get my food. Literally. A literal hour. For a few burritos and tacos.

Nope!\n\nFrom the hour I had to observe the whole process, I think I figured out why. Everyone here seems very nice. But only a few people are working at any one time. And they're not very quick. Everything is made slowly one item at a time.\n\nThey also don't make the food in order. Uber Eats orders? Front of the line. They'll work drive thru in after that. Eat in orders last. If they're slammed by Uber Eats? No food for you. You're going to have to annoy them at the counter to even get them to start on your food.

Had they given me the option of waiting 30 minutes+ we would have declined, but would have likely tried again someday.  \n\nAfter making a bit of a stink she refunded my money and we went to KFC.  Sad, because I really liked Popeyes but they will never waste another minute of my time."},

The dining room area was really clean!  \nThis is a fast food chicken place that specializes in \"Louisiana\" style chicken.  Which by their estimation means spicy.  And for fast food chicken, it's not terrible.  I like the spice.  Kids were ok with the popcorn shrimp and mild chicken tenders.  They also had the Mac and cheese and had no complaints.  While I don't like the stuff, they did, even though it seemed like the consistency looked a bit off.\nThe popcorn shrimp is nothing crazy, but they are decent.  Biscuits are way better than KFC.  And the chicken wasn't super greasy either.  However, my fries were pretty cold.  And the seasoned green beans, kinda soupy. The place is a guilty pleasure of myne as I like their fries (normally, and hot).  Also their specials can't be beat, sorry colonel. I would say there aren't enough NON spicy things for kids.  But I'll always come by if I'm solo for a quick lunch."},

Folks, don't forget, when you read a propensity of poor reviews for a restaurant, it is a back-biting business. Some businesses will stoop to anything to get an illegitimate edge on the competition. So, be skeptical. We have seen several good little restaurants run out of business by spurious bad \"reviews\".  As to poor service, never forget, in this awful Covid season, we are doggone lucky any of these folks are willing to go to work to feed the rest of us, and if they forget your biscuits, cut them a little slack. These are stressful times. If you don't have to work in a fast food restaurant, be grateful someone is willing to, and BE KIND.

Unbeknownst to us, in the course of this, they broke the lids to the sides, which caused the green beans to leak and soak the bag, so when we got home the bag burst and we lost 2 of the sides. Because the ride is so far away it was not possible to go all the way back to replace the sides. I feel that the workers should put sides in a separate bag with parger orders. I am very unhappy with Popeyes, especially after spending nearly $50 on dinner."},

I know my bank, I banked with them for 25 years, if it is pending, I will be charged for it, Could not get hold of the day manager, tried 3 times to call him the next day as directed, no one answered phone.\n\nI love Popeye's but when you know you have staffing issues, fix it, retrain people & tell them not to keep going on & on when the customer is standing in the store showing you proof THEY WERE CHARGED. It's rude, I nearly said something to her in a very nasty heated tone but refrained because I was hoping for satisfaction which I got none & I will not say anything bad about her other than she is rude & needs retraining, not to lose her job but retraining & needs to learn that when a customer shows you proof, DO NOT CALL THE CUSTOMER A LIAR."},

He said that because too many people have bailed and so they won't do phone orders anymore. Take payment first! I told him I was on my way and I would appreciate if they could start my order. He hung up. If what I want isn't in your menu how is that my fault? I came in - order was not started. It takes them about FIFTEEN minutes to make this particular menu item. I'm tired of waiting 15-20 mins EVERY time I go in. WTH...\n\nSECONDLY there is a lady that makes sandwiches all day.

I planned my entire day around it, did my FM shopping across the street timed perfectly to get me in and out by 6:30 before they got crushed. I ordered on the app. I use it all the time. We experienced no hiccups ordering. Except I picked the 3 piece dinner with biscuit and one side (beans and rice) and no drink, so the total was only $9.39. Proof that I had added the promotional sandwich to my cart came when it said I couldn't check out using that promotion as it was under $10 total. So I added an additional $3.99 chicken sandwich to the order, and it worked fine. I had the 3 piece chicken, one biscuit, and one beans and rice (which by the way was never included in the order once I got it home), and one $3.99 chicken sandwich on the \"ticket\" (receipt). The promotional sandwich was not visible, but that didn't bother me since it is free, and therefore not in the total charged. And because, not only did I start the entire order by clicking the picture of the promotion on the app, but I was denied checkout before hitting the minimum requirement of $10 in order to get the promotional free sandwich.\n\nThe order was ready so fast that it was sitting in a bag on the counter when I arrived 3 minutes later. But no one ever called my name. They were all frantically busy, but I thought they'd call out my name. I only waited 13 minutes before someone asked me my name, and they said it was already sitting there the whole time.\n\nBut the free sandwich wasn't there & I was told they wouldn't give it to me. So I asked to see the boss man.\n\nI can't remember his name tag now, but he said he is the franchisee, so the owner.\n\nI explained what happened, and to my shock, he said his store was not honoring that coupon. It stinks for him that corporate would have the #1 leading add on their country-wide app be a promo that certain stores cannot honor. I fully believe him, BUT as a company owner of a retail store, I also understand that, while it sucks, you just HAVE to honor the corporate coupon. I said he could just write it off. And he said that he could not, that \"they\" take it out of his profits. That blows (if it's true). But I calmly (at first) explained to him that if he could just think from my perspective: Even if it costs you $3.99 (cost would actually be only a buck and change or less), that the reward is the loyalty of a repeat customer (which is evidenced by my order history), and that customer will tell others, etc.  That is the ONLY \"Right\" thing to do. It's literally common sense. If you're a business owner, it's 101.\n\nInstead, he just kept showing me the ticket and saying that if it's not on the ticket, it's not part of the order. Makes sense. But it's not my job to understand how their POS system works or receipt printers.\n\nAt this point, I was SO flustered that I said I wanted my \"free f**** sandwich\". I wish I had not stooped so low! He now changed his story that NOW he wouldn't because I cursed. I apologized, but also told him his mask was positioned well below his nose. Common sense is not his strong suit. So he told me, and I'm quoting, \"If I touch my mask I have to change my gloves, and you're the one keeping me here\". This gross flaw in logic had me stymied, so it didn't even occur to me to help him. (i.e. of course you can just change your gloves. You'll have to anyway.) Also, if it slips down just from standing in one place talking with one person, then it MUST be slipping down all the time. This means that not only are his Popeye's employees at risk all around him, but customers certainly are as well.\n\nDisdain for customers aside, he needs to understand how business works. He didn't \"lose\" me because the chicken is great. But it ruined my previously perfect first day off in months :("},

After waiting 40 minutes for my food I tried to get someone's attention to ask for a refund. After 20 minutes of trying to get someone's attention I finally was able to ask for a refund, and instead of giving it to me hey turned around and finally started putting my food together. Of course, I paid extra for extra breasts and did not receive both breasts that I paid for, but at that point I was so exhausted I left. When I got back to the car after nearly an hour and a half inside my sister, who had been waiting in the car, was crying because she felt so sick from missing her medication (which she was supposed to have taken an hour ago with dinner). If they are going to make people wait over an hour for FAST FOOD, they should be turning people away, or warning them before allowing people to order. I have never had a worse fast dood experience in my life, and I will never go to Popeyes ever again. I sent an email about this to corporate, but if this is the kind of service this company condones I doubt I will ever hear back."},

When I brought it up to the manager he snatched it from me grabbed another one and once again no apology. \n\nThis location has an obvious problem with customer service and making sure their customers have a good dining experience. I do hope this location makes some changes for the better."},

If we had In 'n' Out that might make it a race but we don't so Popeye's wins by a landslide. \n\nI used to mess around with the fried chicken until I realized the chicken strips also come in the spicy option, plus there's more surface area to cover with the crispy, wonderful coating. They are also much easier to dip into the blackened ranch sauce which really is half the reason to come here. Dip everything you possibly can into this sauce, it is a gift from the very Heavens above. Hallelujah and amen! \n\nThe sides are ok, when they're fresh they're pretty good (I usually go with cajun fries) but it's not often that they're fresh. Just dip them in the ranch and you'll be fine. \n\nA hint if you're new to the drive thru here, check your order! I've always gotten mine correctly but all my friends swear that they only get a correct order about 60% of the time. \n\nSo in the end the true lesson here is expect fast food, expect to pay a bit more than is normal for fast food, and put blackened ranch sauce on anything you can.

It's basically the newer baby brother of the Kyle location. The newness has worn off and it's no better than big brother further south on the highway. But I digress..\n\nGoing through the drive-thru this particular morning we each ordered a Croissan'wich meals..\nBoth of the croissants were partially burnt, and tasted burnt. The grease dripping out of mine would have required a full roll of paper towel to clean up if it was spilt on a surface. The eggs, or whatever they really are, we're rubbery, as in now I know that rubber chickens lay eggs for the BK Corp. \n\nI realize that fast food is not fine dining, and my expectations are not high, but this was inexcusable. The person at the drive through window chuckled when they handed the bag to me almost as if he knew what was in store when we opened the BK brown bag of doom (B.K.B.B.O.D).\n\nThe dime sized paper weights covered in Vaseline, or as they are called on the menu, hash browns, are probably not biodegradable. They'll be in the landfill for eternity. \n\nAnd finally there are the fountain drinks...\nFor as long as I've been going to this BK the ratio of water to syrup always equals flat. I've left sodas in a can in my car for 3 days that weren't as flat as what comes from their fountain. Kyle is not known for its good tasting water and I believe this place has a hose running straight from a spigot to the machine. This is the kind of fountain drink you have to chew to get it down. I don't understand considering the other fast food places in the area don't have that issue. I have told people taking my order in days gone by that I have two words for them, water filter. \n\nI took two bites of the Croissan'wich I ordered and stuffed in back in the B.K.B.B.O.D. My wife maybe took two more bites than I did and followed suit.\n\nI saw some buzzards next to the road feasting on whatever it was they were feasting on and tossed a few of the paper weights covered in Vaseline. I'm not positive but I think the buzzards flipped me the bird.\n\nI thought I had learned my lesson after the night I went in here and ordered a Whopper with cheese and watched them unwrap a previously made Whopper, slap a piece of cheese on it and put it in the microwave, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, MAYO and all for a full minute.... After this breakfast experience, I am not going back ever again. \n\nEven the entrance from the side facing Home Depot, with it's misspelled words on the sign all the way up to the stair like pavement.... It's literally as if they paved over stairs they had laid flat on the dirt. The whole thing just screams, \"Whataburger is just a little further up the road\"."},

So, during my one week trip in Orlando, we made a pit stop here for a late night dinner after the theme parks. It was pretty packed for a late night dinner. This McDonald's had a bistro menu, which featured pizza, pasta, panini, sandwiches, wraps, and more. Besides the food differences noted in this McDonald's, on the second floor, they have a whole floor dedicated to arcade games. Perfect for the kids. It's actually quite confusing when ordering. You first have to wait in line to put in your order of food. After, you will need to wait in another line to pay for your food. Then you need to wait in line to pick up the food. Geez, I wish there was a more efficient way of doing this. \n\nBetween the four of us, we decided not to get the usual McDonald's food and try their \"bistro\" food. We shared the following:\n\nAngel Hair with Chicken: This was just OK. Chicken wasn't too dry nor too moist. The sauce was quite bland... :( Unfortunately, I think I can make better pasta myself.\n\nTortellini with Shrimp: I really liked the Tortellini mixed in Alfredo sauce. It was cooked perfectly and didn't have an odd taste to it. The shrimp wasn't too fresh though. :/\n\nPizza (Bacon, Pepperoni, Sausage, Chicken, Spinach, and Ham): I forgot what else we asked for in our pizza, but we had about 6 toppings. Not the greatest pizza I have had. Pizza was a bit dry.. It really was just OK. Not even memorable. \n\nThe reason why I'm giving this two stars is also because 1) the person who was putting in our order kept messing up and didn't know where to find certain items on her computer. That was very annoying and we ended up having a receipt with higher prices than what it stated on the menu. We had to talk to the manager and she politely fixed up our whole order. Thank goodness for the manager. 2) When we went to pick up our food, they forgot to give us the garlic breads for both our pasta dishes. We had to tell her that it comes with the pasta dishes and she had to check before giving to us. Geez... Even if I come back to visit Florida in the future, not sure if I'll be back here again after my experience."},

Actually, the most recent visit was the second visit, as I checked it out the last time we were in Orlando.  On both occasions, I'd say the food was fine.  The arcade and play area is fine too.  However, the service was awful.  Upon requesting for an extra plate and silverware (my lil ones were sharing a breakfast platter), the employee had the audacity to roll her eyes and didn't even bother to get the plate.  She pretty much shoved the silverware into my hand and went back to gossiping with her coworkers.  Rude much?  I found service to be just as awful at my first visit back in 2010.  If good customer service is not that important to you, the overall experience isn't horrible.  It's definitely a place where you can kill time with the amusements available and grab a cheap bite to eat."},

When she finally made our pasta(which took her like 5 minutes to do, and she only had 2 orders in front of us) the expo girl was just standing there until we actually told her that our food was ready and she can hand it to us.

The only reason I didn't give this McD's 1 star is because of the better food selection compared to regular McD's. Not to mention the entertainment for the kids, and just the fact that it is a roadside attraction\n\nWith that being said, let's get to the negatives. The service is awful here. It makes me wonder if this McD's is exempt from McD's employee customer service training, because I've never had worse customer service from other McD's. Here's a list of my gripes:\n\n1. It took 25 minutes to get our food, (uhrm, last time I checked, McD's is a fast food place???). \n2. I asked if they have the advertised $1 any size coffee (I badly needed an XL cup), the order taker (different from the cashier, take note) rolled her eyes and scoffed \"we don't have anything for $1 here!\" as if I needed to be scolded for being ignorant of this info. \n3. She then asked if this was \"for here or to go?\" which I answered \"for here,\" so I was specially irritated to find a \"to go fee\" applied to my receipt (which I didn't realize till I already paid). \n4. They seem to have a shortage of change in this restaurant, because my change should have been $1 and some change, but they only gave me a dollar (while the cashier looked away). I didn't mind, because it was just change, but I just think the cashier should have asked for it, if she was so broke & needed to ask for chump change.\n5. Let me reiterate, this was supposed to be a fast food place, but it took  25 minutes to get my food. It wasn't even complete, I had to go back and ask for the salad that I paid extra for, and I never heard a single \"sorry\" for their mistake and slow service.\n6. Their 'taco salad\" was just that, a garden salad inside a (burned) taco, instead of the usual taco salad ingredients you see in mexican restaurants, or even taco bell. It was fresh but tasteless. The chicken was bland, rubbery like it was frozen then microwaved. It was so bad, I asked my hubby if we could switch, he ordered a turkey wrap which was also bland but better tasting than my taco salad.\n7. While we were inhaling our lunch (which is what you do when you're hungry because it took forever to get your 'fast'food, and when you have bland food, there's no reason to savor and enjoy every mediocre bite), the bus boy hit my chair while he was rearranging the chairs behind mine. It had an impact  strong enough, that I almost dropped my turkey wrap. Still, not an apology from him, like I was invisible & he didn't think it was worth saying sorry for.\n8. It was loud and hot inside. I know, they cant control how loud those arcade machines beep (or can they?), but can they at least control the AC temp?\n9. This was the most expensive (relative to other McD's)  I ever spent on lunch for 2 people at McD's. Worst value for the dollar\n\nThere it is, 4 out of 4 (100%!!!) McD's employees made our lunch miserable, ain't that something to write about?"},

Argh so we found seats and to my dismay realized they gave me a breakfast burrito instead of a wrap. I don't eat eggs, so I had to get the kids up, re-pack their meals and head back to the counter. I tried to get someone's attention but was told to wait in line with everyone else. The line was even longer than before. When I got to the front they argued and said thats what I ordered. I showed them the receipt and they said it showed a breakfast burrito. I told them I would have never ordered a breakfast burrito as I do not eat eggs. They never made my order right and said the manager was too busy. I will never go here again. After the kids wanted to play upstairs so I let them. It was dirty and we left. Gross gross gross!"},

It was raining buckets outside.  We made a go at a Disney Park but it was just too wet. So, I looked around to find something fun and indoors for us to do.  i was so excited to find this McDonald's and give it a try.  \nI will say there is one great thing there and that's the play house.  The set up is nice where it's got one entrance so it's easy to make sure kids are safe inside. \nMy daughter and I were both excited about the gaming area as well, because she loves wining tickets and getting prizes.  Well, they are paperless there and you buy this credit card where you add money to buy games (no problem) but it is also supposed to culminate your total winnings on there to go and get prizes.  IT DID NOT!!  The worst part is my daughter won the jackpot on this one game where you hit the button and a ball drops down and lands in a hole with a point value.  she was sooooo excited to win the jackpot because she could get a bigger prize.  Plus she did pretty well on others too.  50 points here....25 there...\nBut when we went to gift shop our card only showed 200 points and not the jackpot. The guy looked at the card in the computer and saw there were several places where it just didn't accrue the wins.  He told me he would credit me back so she could re-play the games.  I was so mad!  I said that wouldn't work because the odds of her winning the jackpot again were pretty slim and asked him to add the points won to the card.  he said no, he couldn't do that.  Then he proceeded to tell me there was no manager after 4 pm.  (which is ridiculous)  Anyway my daughter was really bummed she ended up with a few sheets of stickers.  \nThe other reasons I am marking this with low stars was that it's just so dirty.  Not the play area in general but the restaurant and bathrooms.  Of all the empty tables there was not one clean.  The staff is not friendly and it's set up so poorly for ordering and pick up it's just awful.  \nI say boooooooo to McDonald's for the underhanded way they get away with not giving people points on their cards.  I say booooooo for upsetting my daughter on her birthday vacation and I say get a mop and some cleaning supplies and by gosh if you work there please smile once in a while!!!!"},

You can order from the board in the middle of the restaurant, put your number into the system, and they'll bring you the food.\n\nMy friend got the pasta. I got the pizza. The pizza is probably a medium-sized pizza which starts at $7.99. Adding meat will raise it or if you want to add extra cheese to your pizza. I added bacon, ham, and pepperoni to mine bringing my total to $10.99. My regret is that I didn't have something from their dessert bar but I was too full after the pizza.\n\nProbably took a good 5 minutes to get it but it was definitely worth it. I was surprised by the quality mainly because, well, I'm at McDonald's. The only bad part was that it was pretty greasy to many napkins were used to save my arteries by not ingesting all the grease. Was it the best pizza I've had? No. Was it good. Absolutely. Would I get it again? Sure!\n\nThey had a few other menu items I've not seen elsewhere like some onion burger, guacamole as a side, and strawberry shortcake.\n\nFor me, there is no reason to come here unless you're going to try something that's not at your regular McDonald's.

She went to speak to the manager on shift named Andrew who stared me down. When he came over to us, he acted like we were making the story up & didn't even apologize. He didn't even credit our meals & only gave us a new cheeseburger meal for free. It wouldn't normally be a huge deal but his attitude is the reason I am writing such a lengthy & negative review.

They have the touch screen computers to order or you can go and talk to someone to place an order. Only thing on the computer screens you can not customize your order so beware. \n\nAfter ordering you grab a number and get your drink if you bought one from the self service area and find a seat. Good luck on that. It seems that there is not enough seats to go around how many people go to this place. They have booths of various sizes and high top tables that you can share with others and single tables all laid out. There are 3 floors but the 3rd floor was not open. The elevator was also not working either. Once you grab a seat someone brings out your food after they find you which I'm assuming your number has like a gps in it lol. Food is the same you would buy at any other McDonald's with the exception of having pizza (one size), pasta, and a sub (philly cheesesteak). There are a couple of different burgers on the menu as well but nothing crazy different. \n\nOne thing I noticed that everyone that works there looks miserable to be there. No smiles, your welcome, can I get you anything else, thank yous. Just miserable faces so that sucked to see. \n\nAlso there is an arcade on the 2nd floor as well as the giant playplace. The parents just let the kids run around to do whatever and I noticed some pushing and not so nice playing between some kids so gotta keep an eye out. The arcade is fun to do for a little bit and they have a prize counter as well. \n\nThis would be a one time experience for us and not a repeat for said reasons."},

It's located in the corner of Sand lake and International drive. It's not your ordinary Mcdonalds, it's the biggest McDonald's in the world. It's 2 stories with dining area on both floors. The top floor has an arcade and big place place. We're so pleased to see this place got renovated! It's so much nicer and cleaner than before. Our kid's like to go here because it's Mcdonalds and because of the play area. We like taking them here because after a long day at the parks and spending  $$$ it's a nice cheap meal before we head home to our hotel or condo. \nI'm trying to stay away from fast food as much as I can so if you're like me, this Mcdonalds serves other food like pasta, pizzas and gourmet sandwiches. They have 2 separate kitchen and you can actually see them make your pasta or pizza. Since they remodeled they also have a dessert area too where you can get shakes and ice cream. When ordering, skip the little kiosk. It takes long to put in your order and then you have to get into the regular line after to pay the cashier even thought it has the option to pay on the kiosks. \nNext time you're in Orlando and especially if you're with kids, take them here. They'll have fun and think this is the coolest Mcdonalds!"},

This was awesome to me because if there aren't any seat covers, I make the with toilet tissue. While in Florida, only the airports had seat covers, so I was so elated when I stumbled on this in McDonald's of all places.\n\nFor breakfast they have it where you can order an omellete. You choose the type of egg and quantity, then add the meat and veggies toppings of your choice. They have a brick oven, so perhaps they offer pizza on the lunch/dinner menu.\n\nThey have a huge play area with additional tables and seats upstairs.\n\nAnd last, but not least, they sell icecream - butter pecan caught my eye, but they had at least six different flavors. Next to the ice cream was a chocolate cake with nuts. They sell what appears to be homemade cake. No way! Maybe it was purchased frozen and they just thaw it.\n\nIf you're in Orlando, check it out."},

However, at the \"world's largest\"  they offer a completely different menu.  I had to ask if I could go foward and look at the menu and then come back.  So after we ordered 1/2 the order was picked up at the counter and the other 1/2 was picked up at a different location in the resturant, because we ordered off the regular menu and the gourmet menu.  I had a sorry excuse for a cheesesteak and my daughter had the worst ravioli i've ever tasted.  I mean I usually eat store brand ravioli out of the can without heating it up.  \nJust to add more insult, I once ate at a McD in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.  The restroom was so horrible that I was afraid to even touch the soap dispenser.  I gagged when I opened the door.  No I did not use it, I just left.

Not sure what that means.  This is basically a normal sized McDonalds counter with a 2nd restaurant inside.  You order at one place and can pick from standard McDonalds items or something else from the bistro menu.  The McDonalds food is picked up in one area, the other food in another.  This other food is NOT McDonalds food, the gourmet burger I got from the bistro area was just OK.\n\nThey have a large play area on the first and second floor.  It is a mish mosh of everything, arcade games, tourist booths, hair braiding stations.  It all really did not go together.  What sums this up best is the Bill Cosby cutout leaning against a wall (picture attached).  He was popular in the 80's and hardly funny then.  Why they have him up in the McDonalds makes no sense.  I guess he fits in with everything else that is out of place.\n\nTopping it off, the place was rather dirty.  I rarely eat at McD's, but if I had the craving in Orlando I would go elsewhere."},

Never before though have I been to the \"World's Most Unique\" version of this infamous restaurant.  I actually had no idea that Orlando held the title for having the largest \"Entertainment and Play Place\" in the world.  Or that they have many flat screen TVs, an eating section that replicates a 1950s style diner, or a Juke Box that is located in the front lobby.\n\nAnd before I went inside, I had no idea that McDonald's was capable of serving items like this: Shrimp Alfredo Tortellini, Tuscan Sausage Pizza, Grilled Chicken Burrito, Hot Pastrami Sandwich, and Peanut Butter Explosion Cake.  To my utter surprise, they are in fact very capable, and willing to serve you many dishes outside of their norm.  They do carry the timeless meals we all know, but they have upped the ante with their special Bistro Gourmet Menu.  And for all the visiting tourists, I imagine this has to be a real treat for you as well.  \n\nTheir menus describe this new fare with passion and excitement, take for example the Roasted Turkey Club for $6.39, \"Fresh carved turkey breast piled high and stacked with smoked bacon, American cheese, lettuce and tomato.  Served with herb infused mayonnaise on Italian sliced bread.\"  Call me crazy, but that doesn't sound like the Mickey D's I know.  \n\nAnd should you arrive during breakfast, which is served here from 7am until 10:30am, despite being open 24/7, you'll find more than just an Egg McMuffin.  Check out the Eggs Benedict Panini or the Ham & Cheese French Toast which starts with foccacia bread and is served with a hash brown and sweet maple syrup, all for $4.69.\n\nIf that's not enough, they have taken dessert to the next level.  Again, you can still purchase your favorite McFlurries but you can also try their specialty sundaes made with Hershey's ice cream.   They have a list of about 11 options such as Carnival Crazy, Reese's Going to Pieces, Build-a-Birthday Cake and Deep Dish Apple-Pie-Ala-Mode.  They are priced from $3.69 to $4.29 for the Banana Split.  They also have gourmet pies and cakes on display that look too good to be true.\n\nAs they so proudly proclaim, not only are they proud of their revamped menu, but they are super proud of the arcade/extreme play area upstairs.   Almost every kid I know would go nuts if allowed to roam around here after eating.  They even have a gift shop if you want to forever remember your time here.  Ronald McDonald, you have outdone yourself."},

Once we found out how big it was, we dashed to it after our long day at Universal Studios.\n\n Let me tell you, this McDonalds was indeed large. The building consisted of multiple stories/levels, and the food selection was vast. \n\nThey had your typical mcburgers, mcnuggets, etc., but they also served waffles, pasta (with an exclusive white sauce, only offered at that particular location), oven-made pizza like back in the 90's, and an array of desserts consisting of: cakes, pies, build-your-own Ice cream, etc. It was truly a spectacular sight for all the foodies out there, such as ourselves.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I ordered two buttermilk chicken sandwiches, and made it a combo with fries. We poured our drinks from the super-cool drink fountain which had basically every drink you can fathom. I tried the lime fanta, which was ok. Though, the buttermilk chicken sandwiches were absolutely delectable! Literally the best Mcdonalds burgers/meal we have ever had. The sandwhiches were very fresh and warm with steam coming out of the bites of chicken. The chicken piece was huge, like two normal sized chicken pieces in a sandwhich, and it was very moist and juicy. The bun was a wonderful potato bun with a butter glaze ontop. The sauce had a prominent buttermilk taste to it, as suggested by the name, the burger was well-presented and definately not sloppily assembled. \n\nOverall, the buttermilk chicken sandwhich from that Mcdonalds location was a solid 5/5, and I recommend you all to try that sandwhich from that particular location."},

What is there to be enthusiastic about? They work at a giant and abnormally loud McDonald's. I actually appreciated their lack of enthusiasm. It helped me form a real human connection with them, and it gave me the feeling that we were in this thing together.\n\nThere are multiple videogames on the ground level and the upstairs level. It is just like Dave n Buster's only a) there is zero excitement b) nobody is smiling c) the customers are all big, slow, and have no peripheral vision, so you'll feel like young Marshall Faulk weaving through a crowd of linemen. \n\nHaving spewed all that negativity, let me say that this isn't the worst place in the world, and it is actually a great restaurant for those who enjoy being overcome with profound sadness. :-("},

I got their pizza, ravioli, and Belgian waffles. The pizza was customizable so there was no going wrong for that but it was very greasy. I felt a bit sick after eating a nice. The Belgian waffles had super soggy strawberries so that wasn't that pleasant. The only good thing I enjoyed was probably the ravioli. It tasted pretty good and the chicken was well seasoned! I probably wouldn't try any of these items again though. \n\nThe inside was extremely nice. Tons of tables around and the entertainment section was at the upper level. Plenty of arcade games.

I was blown away by their offerings and how different things were in this McD's compared to the ones back home that I was so used to. For starters, there was a guava and cheese pie that they had.  We had to get a few for our group.  They were so tasty.  They were fresh, flaky and so yummy.  They're like nothing that we have at home, in Los Angeles, CA.  More often than not, anyway, we don't have the pleasure of indulging in freshly baked pies from McD's.  It's a rare thing.  \n\nAnother thing about this location that was so different to me was that they pretty much had a show kitchen for their pasta making.  I thought that was pretty neat.  I mean, really, what other McD's have you been to that offered pasta. . . not to mention pasta that you could stand there and watch them make to your specifications?!?! After all, it's not like this is a Vegas buffet line or something.  I was impressed. \n\nI admit, I've always wondered why the Mc D's chain has their Mc Cafe \"section\" if you will.  I understand now.  At this McD's, they have a section of their store that is an ice cream stand basically.  They make their speciality drinks, ice cream cones, sundaes, etc.  This particular section of the store wasn't available or open when I was there but that was because they'd just welcomed three bus loads of hungry tour groups into their store and they'd just come in.  And you don't want hungry people to become HANGRY people. So, I understand that the managers asked the all hands be on deck to help people order and what not.  They also asked that their customers be open to their food being delivered to them as they'd be a tad behind in making as much food as was being ordered.  Sure. I didn't mind that at all.  I was actually really interested in watching this restaurant help THAT many people. \n\nLater on during our visit the McCafe section of the store opened.  We were able to order desserts of different kinds, cake and other dessert pastries included.  It was amazing how many people flocked to their station and ordered up everything that they could get their hands on.  It was crazy but it was awesome I must admit. \n\nI was missing a portion of our order that was supposed to be delivered to our table. I immediately let one of the managers know as he was touring the floor to be sure that everyone got what they needed and what they'd ordered.  I was really impressed at home efficient he was in getting his staff members to kinda fetch what was needed to make the experience that much better. The manager made sure to quickly get what we needed and to be sure that we received everything that was going to make our experience that much better. \n\nI didn't have any real issues while I was here and I have to say, I wish that more stores in my area would model themselves after this store and how they worked so well like a brilliantly well oiled machine. I'd love to return sooner than later but the fact remains, this store is not just a lil ways away from me. . . it's all the way on the other side of the country from me. Damn it!\n\nI'd love to come back during a time it isn't so busy.  My lil one would have loved to have the opportunity to play in their kids play area upstairs, yeah upstairs. I forgot to mention that this is a multi-level store.  I didn't have the chance to go up there myself but my husband told me it looked potentially amazing.  Again, potentially only because our lil one wasn't able to play up there with all the big big big kids up there, most of them just coming from the tour buses. \n\nI really liked that this store had their own hashtag but also tons of dining space, clean dispensers for things like drinks, napkins, etc.  My lil one enjoyed looking at the aquarium.  She loves fishies. This was quite an experience for our family. Awesome!"},

This, IMO, is a step above it!\n\nI remember as a kid in the late 90s, going on a family vacation and being brought to the \"biggest McDonald's in the world\". While I have no idea if it is the biggest Micky D's, it sure is a pretty swell one.\n\nBut what separates this location from the thousands of others all across the world? Fast forward to my recent visit, and here are a couple of take aways:\n\nFirst off: It's pretty high tech. Rather than order from a cashier, you order from a machine. Unfortunately when we went, the machines were out of order, so we were unable to actually try out the high tech feature of this place. Turns out that after we had finished eating, the machines were back in order. Sucks, but we'll give it a try next time.\n\nSecond: Arcade upstairs. I don't see many arcades around, especially in fast food joints. Nowadays, fast food joints prefer you to keep a time limit on your stay. This place encourages you hanging out with your family. After eating, we went upstairs and played a few games. It was a fun time! They also have a Play Place available for the younger kids.\n\nThird: The food. Now usually when you think Micky D's food, you think dollar menu, Big Macs, chicken nuggets, etc., but this place is a step above the regular McDonald's food. This place has a bistro that serves gourmet burgers and sandwiches, create-your-own pizzas, pastas, and other things! The pizza was pretty good. I can't really compare it to any other McDonald's pizzas, because let's face it, they don't exist in many other places. The gourmet burger was pretty much the best burger I've had in a McDonald's, while the fries were just as any other McDonald's: delicious.\n\nOverall, if you're in the Orlando area you should give this place a try. If you like McDonald's, you should definitely give this place a try. I do plan on checking this place out whenever I head back to Orlando."},

We have been coming here for well over a decade. It's basically the Chuck E Cheeses of McDonald's. It has gone through many building and menu renovations over time. We miss the larger menu that included burritos but we still had a good time.\n\nThis restaurant relies on ordering kiosks. You can have their classic menu, but we opted for the build your own pizza and make your own pasta. We also tasted the peanut butter chocolate cake and hand scooped ice cream. For a McDonald's the food was fun and unique.\n\nThe games are located on the upper level. You purchase and load a game card. They featured a nice variety of games you would find at an arcade. The decor is fun and nostalgic. My daughter loves Mac Tonight moon at the piano. \n\nUnfortunately we found many of the workers unfriendly and unhelpful. They were not knowledgeable about our food questions or concerns. When getting one of our cakes half was missing and it was difficult getting it rectified. When the kids tried to redeem their game tickets there was a long line and only two workers who assisted one child at a time and waited for them to make their minds up on prizes before moving on to the next kid. We almost left, several other people did in fact leave prizeless. It took almost an hour for prize redemption. \n\nRegardless of the negative, we enjoy this location and will be back. True it's a big tourist trap, but if you are a Micky D's fan and are working your way around the Micky D world, this is a must not miss attraction for the entire family."},

Not at McDonald's?! Yes it's true. The chefs (yes, chefs) cook the pizza in a coal burning oven and make the pasta in front of you. We were impressed. Not enough to give it a try tho lol. \nThe only negatives are the new ordering system. You don't order thru a person. They have large touch screen ordering to speed up orders and a do it yourself way to pay. To me it takes the customer service out of ordering and the touch screen kept having issues to where we had to use a different one.

We tried a turkey wrap, ravioli, bistro burger, and philly cheesesteak. \n\nThere is a really cool machine where you can record your own songs, we did a duet and though we sounded horrible, it made for great laughs. I also played a game where you had to operate a claw that had a razor on it to cut the string of your prize. I won three of these and each prize was a stuffed animal, silly bands, and a generic Ipod that looked like the real thing. \n\nIf you're vacationing in Orlando this should definitely be on your list."},

It's McDonald's...what can you expect?\n\nPlease be aware that there is approximately, a 50% markup compared to the prices you are used to at your local McDonald's.  I recommend that if you are dining inside to please say your order is \"to go,\" to ensure that your food is warm.  We told the cashier we were dining in and by the time table runner brought us our food, it was stone cold.  I never return my food, so I just endured the chewy fries.  \n\nAlso, if you are bringing children do NOT leave them unattended or use the elevator.

Where could you go wrong? By adding an arcade that doesnt have standard or fair time limits. Let me elaborate.  We played air hockey and the game cut off before we even had 3 points.  It was already hard to play because of the low quality puck. \nOutside of this, the McDonalds has a pasta pizza area where you can watch your items prepared over the fire. We go to the 2nd floor where the seating ranges from standard, bench, lounge seats, etc. The stairs and elevator are near each other so even if you cant sit where you can watch your kid (very few seats can), you can at least watch the exits to make sure they aren't leaving. The play space is awesome two story taking up the 2rd and 3rd floor. The arcade is almost a plus if you have, if you dont, still go but give your kid clear expectations beforehand. The machines take a card not coins. The card comes with purchase. The machine takes cash and card. Make sure to follow all the prompts on the machine and card reader. There is a slot to insert in the card reader. If you try to swipe you will get the transaction cancelled.  Delivery to the tables is nice but I wish they had pop refill upstairs.

More like HELL ON EARTH.\n\nI was so looking forward to this place. I usually can't stand McDonald's because 3-4 hours later, you'll end up really regretting that Hot N' Spicy you just couldn't live without. And this McDonald's was one of the worst I've been to.\n\nYes, it does have a whole upstairs floor of video games like 4-person air-hockey, guitar hero, connect 4, deal or no deal, ski-ball, and car racing games. You'll also find plenty of perfect picture moments like the stand-up Bill Cosby, Ronald McDonald on the bench and the artwork on the outside of the building. They do also have other food than the usual greasy, heart-stopping McDonald's gourmet, like waffles, panini sandwiches, and plenty of good desserts. You can also get a balloon animal or a face painting from the people in the corner for 10$.\n\nNow onto the bad side; This place is in such bad repair. Whilst buying a new game card at the kiosk, I was being rained upon by the hole in the ceiling above the tacky alligator head. 6 games were broken including (face place, two ski-ball machines, the water-shooter game, connect 4, etc). Two of the card kiosks were broken so the line for the only working one in the back was enormous. The manager had to be pretty much wrangled from his comfortable chair in his private room near the elevator to bother to lift a finger to fix it. \n\nThe ticket service representatives in the front near the deli are ridiculous. Do NOT fall for their \"reduced tickets\" scam. They want you to go and stay at their resort, which includes a 2-hour, extremely boring and dull presentation. You CAN just buy tickets here without the resort scam, but the minute you tell one of these people that you aren't interested, you'll be treated like dirt on the bottom of their shoe. \n\nThe staff in this place really, really ruined the experience for us. The teenage girl who was manning the \"gift shop\" was a total brat. She was totally put out that she was having to wait around for the kiddos to pick out their gifts. Well, guess what? THEY ARE KIDS AND THEY ARE INDECISIVE. Get off of your SMARTPHONE and do YOUR JOB. \n\nThis place was a definite tourist trap and was such a waste of time even though they had some really cool video games and picture opportunities, I will never, ever be back. Keep your wet, dangerous ceiling with all the holes and your cardboard pizza."},

WUTTTT. I had to check it out for myself. My family and I decided to check it out for breakfast. In addition to the normal McDonald's menu, this place also serves waffles, pizza, pasta, omelettes, and has a variety of desserts that include cheesecake and cakes. Since we came to breakfast, we decided to try out the waffle and omelette. You can order everything including the \"gourmet\" items off the self-serve computers located in the middle of the restaurant. If you were paying cash, you would have to go pay at the counter. If you are using a credit card, you can pay directly from the computers. The waffle and omelette was okay. The quality wasn't outstanding but again this is McDonald's. It was cool to have a McDonald's that is different from what we are used to. Service was okay. They brought our food to our table. There is a huge arcade and PlayPlace upstairs. It is definitely cool to check out this McDonald's if you are in the Orlando area. If you don't like McDonald's, come check this place out for the arcade and PlayPlace. Great place for families!"},

Aside from that, what a failure of a system for service, efficiency and a sub par effort at making this place special, given its a premier McDonald's location and listed as the largest in the world. Ordering is a self service process that is time consuming. Food was received out of order, inaccurate and an hour after ordering and it was not busy at all. Probably 15% capacity at most, mid winter on a Wednesday in Florida. Customer service sucked. People were unfriendly and not helpful. Eating areas are upstairs and downstairs, yet there is no condiments or soda machines upstairs, or areas for suppory, so anything you need you have to go downstairs. The additional entertainment you don't see at all McDonald's was a small arcade and an automated fake 50s music figure. In all, a failure. I didn't expect a lot. Still, bad enough that I downloaded this app just to write this review."},

Talk about going the EXTRA distance... very friendly, very clean, tasty... just what I was looking for... thank you McDs!\nKUDOS to all those working hard and taking care of your customers here - it does get noticed. Thanks again!!"},

They are very unresponsive, you should have SLAs for how long it takes the dumb screen to respond when I select an option. C) this is fast food, right? It took 12 minutes to get my order, and it was WRONG. Maybe they should fire the employees that refused to take the order at the counter?  D) hire employees that care. When I went up to get my order corrected, the employee that went to get missing items had already moved on to the next customer. E) serve fresh items.

First impression of the renovation? Well, as stated in my check in, \"whoa, \u00fcber modern!\" \n\nFirst off, you order on a machine. After that, you have to get in another line to pay. After that, there's an additional line just to actually get your food. As my husband said, \"it's way more complicated than it has to be!\" I'd definitely have to agree. \n\nPersonally, I've never been a huge McDonald's fan, but I was surprised to see their menu includes pastas and pizzas made in brick ovens. We just went because our son was begging us to check it out and he loves the idea of a \"happy meal\" (even though he usually doesn't even eat half of it) but maybe one day I'll actually eat something there, too! \n\nUpdate: While I found myself initially wowed by the shiny new renovation, new technology, and expansive menu (compared to other McDonald's), it's all worn off, now. This is my second Friday night in a row here because my 4-yr-old loves the place, but customer service is almost nonexistent. I mean, once you order, you stand around in a cluster of other people who are also waiting for their orders, while you wait to hear your own order number obnoxiously shouted at you. Yes, there's a lot of people, it's a big place & already loud enough, so the employees have to be loud, as well, in this scenario. But couldn't they just put up an electronic sign or something, indicating which order number is ready, instead of shouting like they're herding cattle or something?"},

Sounds simple right.  NOT HERE.\n\nFirst you have to decide if you want the usual McD shake that we know and love; or if you want one made with Blue Bunny ice cream and if so which flavor, in order to know the flavors you have to look in the freezer, and remember which one, so you can tell the cashier.  (Who didn't speak English! and had to get an interpreter to understand us!!! That is just seriously wrong!!!) \n\nFinally we get our orders placed, go to the pick up station and wait.  I decide to go find a table, no problem at 9:30 pm there was plenty of tables, but still had lots of people like us inside (this place is huge!!)  But feels cramped because of all the game tables, low black ceiling, huge signs everywhere, super big fish tank, and other junky stuff around.  The upstairs is like Chuck E Cheese meets Ronald McDonald.  Loud, flashing lights and kids out of control.\n\nWe were going to allow the kids to play a couple of games, until we found out we had to use a credit card (no cash accepted), the games are played on 'credits' and you buy the credits and they give you a credit type card for the players to put into the game slots.  When your card runs out of credits you keep the card as a souvenir or fill it up again. What a load of non sense.  We were expecting to have to give the kids a few dollar bills, maybe 10 at the most and they get to play a couple games, nope, not if we have to put it on a credit card (we don't use credit cards, only cash or debit).\n\nSo, you have been warned.  Everyone who has kids and go to Int Drive should at least go inside and let the kids see the largest McD's in the world, but if you can avoid this place.  \n\nThe restrooms were horrible!    We girls would not use them, we went to the gas station across the street, it was cleaner and smelled 100% better!!  And, I am not usually a \"girly girl\" when it comes to bathrooms, this was just the worse public restroom I have ever seen or smelled.  Even some port'a potties are cleaner!"},

Yes they are in the heart of the tourist area but that is no excuse to charge the prices they do.  It's McDonald's so there was no real difference between it and any other McDonald's in terms of food quality.  They do offer a nicer McCafe with a selection of Ice Creams and other desserts.  In addition they offer pizza and pasta but again the prices they charge are on par with an actual sit down restaurant for pizza or pasta so save your money and go to a nicer and better restaurant.  The place is a novelty and so go and visit but just get a small coke and save your money for much better food elsewhere."},

As soon as we walked through the glass doors it was as if we entered the Wild West. Sweet baby Jesus, kids were running rampant, out of control unorganized line up at your risk lines, frozen touch screen menus that didn't work, and to top it all off the food was overpriced. I know it's business I get that but come on at least serve something good. I had the pizza where they up charge you for EVERYTHING my pizza was over $13. I could have gotten 2 medium pizzas  and a soda  for that price. My nephew had bacon  cheese   and Belgium waffles. Plus we ordered 2 large . Food was almost $40. Smh! So the taste? But, of course you want to know....it tasted like a frozen pizza from the supermarket. I was not thrilled. I'm from NJ and I know a thing or two about good pizza . For crying out loud they cooked it in a authentic brick oven. It taste like it came out of my microwave back 1996. I expected more. On the upside my nephew enjoyed his waffles & fries . It took about 20 minutes before we were served. Staff was nice and friendly. It's a great place to take the kids . Just be aware it's very busy and it's going to cost ya."},

We went in and its not like any McDonald's I've ever seen.  They had like a billion (well like 4) soda machines that you can add your flavors and everything (we have those) and the normal counter to order.  But they also had kiosks that you could go up to and order.  They had an ice cream case and a pretty yummy looking dessert case too.  We used the kiosk.  I wanted to be able to take my time and peruse the menu.  In the end we ordered some old favorites, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Cheeseburgers; and some new fun things like a McPizza and some McPasta.   We took our number and went to find some seats.  You can sit upstairs or downstairs and there are many seating formats.  You could belly up to a counter, hunker down into a booth, or gather around a table.  The chairs were all different and each little area was themed.  We went upstairs (There are elevators too!) and sat down in the Mac the Knife room.  I then wondered how would they find us with our food.  Well my answer came pretty quickly when I looked up and saw a TV screen with the various pager numbers up there, how long they've been waiting, and what room they were in!  Soon our food was arriving.  The old favorites were what you'd expect.  The pizza wasn't as good as I thought it would be considering they have these pizza ovens that looked legit.  The crust was doughy and the cheese and sauce didn't have much flavor.  It was just eh.  The McPasta was okay as well.  Reminded me of what you'd find on a buffet.  Edible, but not blowing anyone away.  After we ate I checked out the bathroom because I heard they had those automatic seat covers.  I never trust those things.  Is that really a new wrap on that toilet seat or does it just go round and round.  Hmm.  I didn't go. But they were clean and bright!  Then we let the kids each have $20 to play in the play area.  The games are fun but they're pretty stingy with tickets.  If my son hadn't won the Angry Bird Jackpot my kids would have had $40 chinese handcuffs.  Instead my son got a mini nerf gun and a paddle ball thing and my daughter got some sort of slime and a Grimace pin.  lol.  $40 well spent.  There was a play area too which I would never let my kids in because it is so large and intertwined I'd never find them, or they'd get sick because I am sure its never cleaned.  And while we were there a kid decided to experiment with the round windows by pulling down his pants and sticking his $#!^ onto it.  Nice.  The management did jump in and talk to the parents about this but it went on for awhile before that happened.  \nAll in all glad I could say I did it but don't need to return unless I just want McDonalds for some reason and I happen to be standing right here."},

This is the WORLD'S LARGEST MCDONALD's, right here in the good ol' USA.  As you walk in, you see bald eagles soar against a backdrop of American Flags while 'God Bless the USA' plays softly in the distance; your soul swells with American pride as you quietly whisper to yourself, \"If the Founding Fathers could only see us now.\"  All jokes aside, I don't know why the reviews are so terrible. It's a McDonald's... not a Michelin starred restaurant-- expectations should be adjusted accordingly and I was thoroughly impressed with the place!\n\nI came early in the morning on my way out of Orlando. We were greeted by the manager who was extremely helpful, friendly, kind, and an overall a great person to interact with early in the morning. He assisted us in ordering and made us feel very welcome!\n\nYou order at self-serve kiosks and then have a few minutes to marvel at this behemoth until your food is ready. This place has a bakery (with cake & cheesecake!), scooped ice cream, a full arcade, a massive play structure with a giant alligator inside (?), a pizza oven (!!), a fish tank (!!), and a whole plethora of specialty items you can't find at any other McD's. For breakfast, the specialty items are the Belgian waffle & a customizable omelet-- I knew I had to order both to really take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity :)\n\nOnce you place your order, you sit down & they serve you. If you order regular McDonald's food (i.e. egg McMuffin, Hash Brown, etc), it comes in the normal McD's wrapping. However, if you order the specialty items, they serve them on real plates with real cutlery!! *insert clapping emoji here*\n\nIn terms of food quality, the regular McD's menu items were the same as always. The homemade omelet was a bit on the greasy side, but it was just as good as any other diner. It did come with a hash brown, but was a bit small for the price point (~$8). The Belgian Waffle however was excellent. We upgraded ours to get blueberries, strawberries, & whipped cream added and I'd definitely recommend you do the same! The waffle had nice little grooves that allowed you to easily pull off pieces which made it convenient to share. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the berries weren't in any kind of sugar syrup. They were probably frozen and had a bit of a juice on them, but it wasn't sweetened at all which was pleasantly unexpected.\n\nOverall, if you're in Orlando, you have to go here, even if just to say you did. Fun experience and food McDonald's food that you won't find anywhere else!"},

Husband has daily work commitments here, so I have been on my own with my son. Came to this McDonalds because I needed a quick easy option for food and entertainment for a 1 yr old. \n\nOrdered our food at the touch screen menu. After waiting for almost 20 min, and my son is getting irritable at this point, I saw another family get their order. I asked them how long they had been waiting - they said about 8 min. I asked one of the cashiers if she could give an ETA on the order. She rolled her eyes at me and said sort of under her breath  she's been at the register, hows she supposed to know. She went to one of the other employees and the response was they are still working on it. \n\nKept waiting. By this time, my son needs a diaper change. I went to do that. Came back, food still not there. It's now been over 30 min. I went back to the counter and told them how long we've been waiting. Just as I said that, someone dropped off the food at our table. The woman I assume was the supervisor also gave me a dismissive glance, no comments on the situation. \n\nThey were missing a drink order, and one of the items was cold. At that point, wasn't worth bringing it up to them. \n\nWhile I was feeding my son, employees were walking past me handing out trays. Not one person apologized, acknowledged me or even attempted to reconcile the situation. \n\nI work in a fast paced environment as a nurse on a trauma unit. I understand the pressure of having multiple people make demands from you all at once. If there is simply too much going on that service will inevitably be less than ideal, customers will likely be empathetic. But communication is key. I talk to my patients, I tell them I know they are waiting, and I apologize, even if it's not my fault. \n\nThe employees were absolutely rude and unprofessional. Their attitude made me feel as if I were imposing on them. \n\nHad I been alone, I would have been more patient. But trying to appease a 1 year old who is hungry and bored is a whole other situation to manage. \n\nLike I said, I'm from out of town, so they won't be getting any more of my business anyway. But this was awful service. Would not return."},

Now that observation is coming from an adult over 50 with no distractions.  I've been to McDonald's in Paris, France just to get the \"Royale with cheese\" and a Le Big Mac. (Thank you pulp fiction) \n\nI came to this \"epic Mc D\" because I had heard so much about it. They have Kiosk Island\" with people standing there to assist you with questions. () All employees wearing masks.. But to be fair that is at every McDonald's.  How is this place different?\n\nIf you are under the age of 10, which made up the majority of the ruffians tonite, well, it doesn't get any better. The second floor arcade looks like a scene from a frenetic Chucky Cheese with tickets being spit out at every game. Of course you can get prizes in exchange!\n\nThe 2 story playground was closed due to covid so  but I understand.\n\nThis is an expensive McDonald's.  Be prepared to shell out some bucks esp for the unique menu items.\n\nNow the 10% and some tips:\nThey have food here you can't get anywhere else.  I ordered a French toast sandwich and custom ordered it. It was not prepared by McDonalds per se.  It appears there is a station that makes pizza, Belgian waffles, omelets and my French toast sandwich.  If you order a specialty item, be patient because they take time to prepare. So yummy! I saw the guy with the bread in the pan toasting it, Not spitting out of a machine!\n\nI think that station is subcontractors for McDonald's because they don't act like employees but more like short order cooks.\n\nOk. Here is the big tip. If you want to try different hot foods, don't order all at the same time. Food gets cold quick. (I'm talking to you french fries!!) Instead over in waves.  \n\nHope this was helpful.  Of course if you go with a big group of friends at 2 am thats always fun but that goes without saying."},

It's amazing to me how one bite can ruin an otherwise average burrito. If I wanted gristle, I'd go to Mexico where it's normal. Satiate my American palette, dammit! Even though the chicken wasn't great, the rice was flavorful. Too much cheese for my taste, and it overwhelmed the delicate poblano pesto flavor that I thought I would really enjoy. I asked for the fiery sauce, and the sauce they put on was pretty darn mild. \n\nPrices are a little high for what you get, but it was the lunch rush, so maybe they were rushing to accommodate the hoards of people lined up for their grub. One bonus: They seem to be very aware of dietary restrictions (vegan, low-carb, etc) and offer a lot of options for picky people. It's nice to know that Qdoba cares about my preferences. *sigh*"},

I can support that claim because just today, the man serving the guacamole recognized me and gave me extra! As for the owner, he's also a pretty cool guy. I was dissatisfied with my meal once and he apologized to me 100 times and gave me a voucher for a free burrito. \n\nI usually get the chicken burrito or taco salad; I can't vouch for the nachos or quesadillas as I've never tried them.

It's even lamer that they have to gringo-fy the toppings, like calling pico de gallo \"mild salsa\". Even lamer-er if they put shredded cheese on your bidness. The only time I got cheese on my grilled chicken burrito, I got a mouthful of tortilla, sour cream, and bland ol' cheddar. Do not want. \n\nIt's not authentic, blah blah blah....but give me Qdoba or Boloco any day (if I can't have my first choice of fast-food Mexican) over Taco Bell. At least it's a hefty step up, and as a result I'm far less likely to become host to a tapeworm and/or spend my days and nights praying to the porcelain god. Ay, no es bueno!"},

But, they're really good for what they specialize in. \n\nAtmosphere can be noisy, but it's a clean place and is decorated brightly.\n\nI've never had a bad experience here. (knock on wood)\n\nPS - College students, they take Fenway Cash and the Huskies Card and all that other good stuff."},

The quesedillas are great, you probably won't find too many places in Boston with great quesedillas, but that's mainly because the Mexican food \"bar\" in Boston is not that high.  In any case, if I want a burrito or quesedilla somewhere close to where I live, this is usually the first place that comes to mind.  There's also Bolocco, but that's not the best place in terms of eating enjoyment.  Bolocco's strength is originality and making burritos that are actually healthy (or close to it).  \n\nQdoba is a nationwide chain, so it's not a local joint by any means.  However, I think it's worth a try for anyone in the neighborhood.  Their pico de gallo is especially great, in my opinion.  It's definitely a far cry from authentic Mexican food, but if you're in Mission Hill or Fenway I highly recommend checking this place out for a quick bite.

You know its all about those burrito bowls. \n\nThis was my first time at this location and I almost didn't eat there.  \n\nThere was a fly flying around in the area where they prep your bowl.

Why am I being charged extra for guac at a place that serves \"Mexican\" food?  I will probably never request guacamole again, as this is got to be the biggest rip off in the joint.  I mean you can buy avocados for less than a dollar when you are buying them in bulk as I'm sure this place does, so they are making 1000% profit off this up-charge.\n\nThis location sells some beer and I think I saw someone with a margarita, but we were sitting outside on the patio, so it may have been one that she smuggled in for herself.  I can only image how much a margarita would cost if they charge you $2 extra for guacamole. \n\nMost of the other reviews speak of how pack this place normally is.  That wasn't the case for me.  I walked in and was next in the serving line and there were plenty of tables for me to choose from.  Admittedly, I was there right at 5 pm on a Thursday, so it possible that at that time of the day, most folks are stuck in traffic on 285.

My disdain has nothing to do with the food, atmosphere, or the customer service--it is the WAIT.  Months ago, it would have been nothing for me to grab lunch at Chipotle multiple times per week.

The Galleria Parkway (within a stone's throw) is one of Georgia's busiest work complexes.

I have been coming to this location for about 6-7 months now and I have only grown more and more frustrated over that period of time, to the point now where I refuse to return here. Tonight I placed an online order about an hour and ten minutes before picking up. When you place an online order a phone number is required with their reasoning being \"we will contact you if there are any questions/inquiries regarding your order.\" It is now 2 minutes before my scheduled pickup time, I am standing at the unmanned register while witnessing one of the employees shout out the following to the ~10 or so people standing in line: \"we are out of chicken, lettuce, guacamole, corn salsa, and guacamole.\" I will elaborate on this stocking issue in a moment. Everyone in line the proceeded to turn around and walk out of the restaurant. Keep in mind that this is 30 minutes before closing. How they expect to serve people for the remainder of their shift is beyond me. So here I am, finally being acknowledged at the register with a, \"can I help you?\" while at the same time my phone starts ringing. One of the employees in back was calling me to inform me that they couldn't fulfill my order. Really? It had been well over an hour since I placed my order. They decide to wait until I have already driven to their location and am standing at the register, after I have already learned of their shortcoming, to call me and give me the heads up that they can't fulfill my order. Had I received this notification early enough I could have picked up food somewhere else, no big deal. However at this point the only other options I'd consider for a quick fix meal late at night are closed. \n\nThis is not the first time this has happened, but rather it is a reoccurring issue. I never encountered the problem of this location running out of several key ingredients until about two months ago, and since then my girlfriend and I joke about it every time I place an online order or talk about picking something up. \"Make sure you have a backup plan.\" Well it strikes again. How can a store that consistently has a 20+ minute line wait seemingly so often be unprepared to complete a shift fully stocked on ingredients? This has happened at least four times in the year 2015 already, and it has come to the point where I only try this location once every two weeks anyways (so who knows how often it is happening otherwise!). \n\nLong lines, inconsistent portions (be careful who is prepping your bowl that day when you decide to spend $1.80 on guacamole, chances are you'll get shorted), inability to maintain stock levels (only can confirm this being an issue for final hour of operation but is a routine problem), lack of consideration/attentiveness with online orders in calling me promptly regarding their inability to complete my order, I am done with this location. I love the brand and will continue to be a customer at other locations but never again on Cobb Parkway. I have given them far too many chances.\n\n**Quick edit: I gave this location 2 stars simply because they have given me many a great service in the past. That, however, all seemed to end right around the time the calendar turned to 2015. Such a shame."},

The line was very long and I was optimistic that our visit would be a great experience.  I could not have been more wrong.  \n\nI'm not sure where to even start.  Unbussed tables, overflowing trash cans?  How about the restaurant being out of chips?  Yes, really.  The worst part is that when I asked for chips w my son's quesadilla, the response was \"No chips.\"  I thought that the quesadilla (with very little cheese and a few pieces of chicken) didn't come with chips.  Since we weren't mind readers or Jedi's, I asked for chips at the register where we were informed that they were OUT of chips.  Inexcusable. \nA Mexican restaurant was out of chips.  \n\nNext, let's discuss the \"salad.\"  They were out of corn and cheese and the manager had to get more.  What's worse-there was no salad dressing and when I asked for it, the staff appeared to be put off by my request.  I just wanted salad dressing.  \n\nThe water was even bad and tasted like plastic.  This a feat not accomplished by many restaurants.  \n\nThere was no apology or even a second thought given.  I will never go back to this location and likely never any Chipotle period."},

I wanted cheese and there was NONE in the container on the line so I asked did they have more cheese... Needless to say I was wrong to ask. The guy snatched the container and went to the back to get more not saying a word! Literally bothered by doing their job. Then I get to the register and tell her I have two orders.

I have never been more disgusted with the way I was treated at an establishment in my life! I am appalled at the way my boyfriend and I were spoken to by one of the employees last night. \n\nWe came in to order food. I ordered a burrito bowl. The gentleman preparing the tortillas and serving the rice, beans, and meat was very polite. The girl that was then serving the remaining ingredients was extremely rude. It was obvious that she didn't want to be there. She was sloppily throwing ingredients into my bowl (guac in the corner, sour cream in the other corner, soupy tomato salsa that she couldn't care to drain) she was trying to rush so fast (no line when we arrived) that she wasn't even listening to what I was asking for... That was just the beginning. \n\nMy boyfriend, Who was right behind me, ordered a quesarito. Again, the same girl who was being sloppy with my food (and his because she had to scoop off ingredients since she decided she wasn't going to listen to his order either) began to wrap his quesarito. while she is doing this all of the contents of the quesarito fell out and she was unable to close it. This was no longer a burrito of any kind. She then tried to cover it up by putting the side that was open on the bottom and covering it up with aluminum foil. (We are aware that sometimes this is something that happens. In most cases, the chipotle employee will a) ask if you would like it remade, or b) automatically grab a new tortilla and transfer the contents to the new one without the customer having to ask. Once we realized she was trying to cover it up, my boyfriend asked her if she could remake it. Her immediate snappy response was \"I CANT HELP IT IF IT RIPS!\" We both said we know that but clearly it needs to be remade. It wasn't even a burrito anymore. The two women who were in line behind us agreed saying they would not have accepted that either. The associate then goes \"well do you want me to put it in a bowl?!... Do you want  new aluminum foil?!\" To which my boyfriend replied \"no I would like a quesarito\" ..... because this is what he asked for in the beginning. She spent more time going back and forth with us over not remaking the food than it would have actually taken to prepare another quesadilla for the quesarito. (Let me just say that my boyfriend orders this every time we go to chipotle... It is always wrapped properly. We have never had a problem before. She just clearly didn't want to do it) \n\nSo then I suggested to her that it should be prepared again but this time, they could probably go a little lighter on the rice and beans because there was a lot. Her next smart response (WITH EXTREME ATTITUDE) was \"Oh so you want less food?\" ... At that point I decided I was done speaking with her. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to leave. The only reason we stayed was because he really wanted the food that we came in there for..... The girl then just storms off and says something Like \"you deal with them\" to another associate who then comes to continue our order (at this point there is a line. The two ladies who were in agreement with me that were behind us had both completed their orders and checked out by this point) the associate who took over our order (not sure if she was a manager or not.) then says \"do you want me to put this in a bowl\" smh.... AGAIN, NO we would just like a quesarito.... FINALLY, They prepared a new one and this time it was prepared correctly and we were finally able to leave. A 3rd girl rang us up and she was very polite. At no point did we ever receive an apology for the way we were treated. It was ridiculous. I love chipotle as much as the next person but I am done with that location."},

I've noticed a consistent pattern of organized chaos with the people that work here. I always come after the lunch rush to avoid the true insanity that seems to exist at every Chipotle at lunch time. This way you avoid the office orders for 10 by the person just in front of you when you've built up such anticipation and hunger from standing in line 30 minutes. lol Today it wasn't so bad, I just got behind the woman that decided she wanted all of her toppings individually placed in cups so nothing touched her food. O_o I have to give credit to the girl that helped her for not having an attitude.\n\nMy first major issue was I ordered a salad bowl with chicken and barbacoa knowing I'd be charged more. When the guy went to put the chicken in there was barely half a spoon of chicken left in the container, he asked about more but it was going to be a little while. Why are you running completely out of meat and it's still a steady flow of customers coming in? Anyway, He proceeded to place barbacoa on top and my bowl moved to the next person. While the person was adding my toppings, there was a girl that kept reaching over my bowl to take or add things to the line, she literally put her armpit over my bowl at least 3 times, not her arm, her armpit and would apologize each time. She reached 4 times total over my bowl. That's not sanitary. When my bowl was passed to the cashier, I was charged for double meat. For not even half a spoonful of meat? \"It was a full serving.\" Ok, whatever, I only eat at Chipotle like once a week, I don't know what a serving looks like. But I do know what an empty container when you've run out of chicken looks like! I paid it, but I decided to write a review and that next time I will ask to speak to a manager. It's Chipotle and it tastes delicious and I'll probably be back later this week because the next Chipotle is like 15 miles away, but I'll be watching closely."},

It's definitely good to see a line, However, it also means that the staff could be a little more efficient. There is always a long line here, always! \n\nMy strategy was to arrive right at 11am when the store opened for lunch, first problem was that the door didn't actually open until 11:03 and people were already waiting outside.  Why not open the door 5 minutes early instead? Second problem, why was the customer service not friendly during the opening hour? I'd like to suggest offering coffee for the employee so that they are a little more friendly at 11am.\n\nAlthough I can't give any additional stars I would recommend that you try chipotle to form your own opinion, then let me know what you think. My past few experiences here on Cobb parkway were just mediocre."},

Please change that. \nThe line was a good 6-7 people deep but it took no time to get through it. I ordered a salad bowl with half chicken and steak with all of the goodies. The bowl was piled high. Eeek so excited. I also ordered some chips and queso to go since that was something that would be easy to eat while I'm driving but sadly i wasn't too impressed with it. The queso isn't your normal white cheese queso but it's a cheddar queso and it has peppers in it which i liked. It was fairly watery in my opinion and was just not what i expected. My chips also didn't taste fresh. That's something i wouldn't get again. I was also really disappointed because i didn't get any of the awesome vinaigrette for my salad. It's my favorite. Oh well there's always next time. The food was so fresh and still delicious without it but the vinaigrette does make it top notch in my opinion."},

More than 90% of the time when I come here they are out of a few dofferent items.. Tonight I came to get a veggie burrito bowl to go. The door said \"sorry we are out of chips\" (In my head I'm thinking coooool not ordering chips, always am squinting as I walk up to door hoping it doesnt say out of guac or salsa, I ALWAYS expect it to read out of ......). I order a burrito bowl with veggies n a side of guac ( guac is free with veggie bowl, I guess in place of meat). They are out of chopped veggies and also out of guac...this is what my bowl is primarily made of and guac is 2 extra dollars if not included in bowl, so I am getting ripped off majorly if my veggie bowl has no veggies or guac!  I got upset and asked to speak with manager and let him know that it always seems they are out of something when I come here, I have expressed this many times to this same manager who is always very pleasant to speak with but he has blamed it on the previous nights prep team, today it was the delivery truck, whatever it is I wish they would fix it. Its almost to the point where I feel the need to call them ahead of time to make sure they have all the toppings available and that is not how a restaurant should operate! I lived in Duluth and went to the Chipolte off of Pleasant Hill for many years and never had this problem!!! The manager gave me 2 buy one get one coupons which is pretty pointless to me bc I live alone ( dnt enjoy chipolte warmed up) work in Woodstock and there is no Chipolte close for me and a coworker to take advantage of this coupon. I never write reviews and I feel bad to bash this location because the manager is always so nice but I have been coming to this location over a year and this is an ongoing issue!!! One last thing the employees seem miserable!!! They know how busy it gets and if they dont enjoy the fast pace enviorment then they should work elsewhere, its like you are bothering them to ask for something.

And it's starting to grow on me. Actually it grew on me a lot. I prefer this place to Willy's now. \n\nWhy? The meats taste slightly better. I love their pork. Also, they serve steamed rice with their burrito (although I doubt it's healthier for you, they probably use a ton of salt in their steamed rice). Some people hate the rice, I love the rice because I'm Asian.\n\nThey also give a choice between fajita style or beans style. I always choose fajita because I don't like to fart too much. And they have corn as a stuffing item. That also gives it an interesting taste and texture. Also, make sure to pay extra to get the guacamole in your burrito. That is the finishing touch. \n\nNow I don't mind the non-free chips. It's probably healthier for me not to eat those.

We were hungry and our tastebuds were ready for it. It was well past the lunch rush, and apparently they had been slammed, because as we approached the front door we were greeted with a huge overflowing trash can (for the outside eating area). It was literally packed down and spilling into a huge pile of trash on the floor, which people had to step through to get in. As we entered, we again saw several overflowing trash receptacles and trash on the floor surrounding them all. There was also trash all over tables and the floor in the dining area. (I suppose, because people figured what's the point of trying to put in the trash bin). It smelled bad and there was no visible employee making any effort to clean.\n\nSince we had been on the road many hours, I needed to use the restroom before ordering. Big mistake. Disgusting and piled up with trash, dirty toilets, sinks, floors... everything. But the on a positive note... there was hot water, soap and paper towels. At this point, I decided the kitchen would obviously be equally repuslive, and I completely lost my appetite.  I decided to go next door to the Corner Bakery Cafe, which was clean, had no line and very friendly staff. I got one of the best salads I have had in a long time. \n\nMy teenage son and nephew decided to stay at Chipotle and they said it was edible, but definitely not what they hoped for. \n\nManagement: hire extra staff for the rush hours, train them how to clean and maintain to an acceptable level, and have a little more pride in your restaurant."},

This involved actually taking the contents out of its original bowl and placing it in a white plate. To my surprise I noticed several hair stands in my bowl as I was eating. Honestly I'm ok with 1 or 2 small strand la but 5-7, ABSOLUTELY NOT!! I would've probably never noticed it until the food was placed on the plate which caused the strands to stand out. Not sure if this happens often as I've never noticed hair in my food before but I suggest taking the contents out of their container and unto a plate and pick through the food to make sure it's clean. I don't believe they wear hair nets, just hats. Also, I would've explained this to the manager but they weren't answering phone calls."},

I'm usually a burrito bowl fan, but this trip I got the tacos.  I was pleasantly surprised and wondered why I had not tried them before.  I got the brown cilantro rice, steak, corn salsa, cheese, guacamole, sour cream and lettuce.  They do charge extra for the guac, but I don't mind because it is quite delicious.\n\nI skipped the side order of chips (since I ended up with 3 flour tortillas by picking tacos), but got an iced tea.  However, both tea urns had sweet tea in them - RUDE.  Someone was not paying attention in the kitchen.  Usually not a fan of sweet tea, I didn't mind it so much since the steak is so spicy.\n\nThis location is kept super clean.  They turn over the tables quickly and someone is always coming through the dining room and making sure the tables have been wiped down and ready for the next group to sit down.  Despite the delays in getting to the front to order, everything else they do is quick and on point.  Plus, they have a good-sized dining room to accomodate and a lot of outside seating - which is great unless it's raining."},

I don't know what is it about this shopping center that just sucks out all the service and good out of restaurants. \n\nI placed an order at 5:30pm for 6:00pm pickup. I arrive at 6:00pm, and the restaurant is a hot mess inside. The line of walk up customers is all around the inside of the building. There's only one cashier who's ringing them up and addressing pickup orders. There's already 2 people ahead of me still waiting on their food, and they said it's been like that for a while. 10 minutes passed and the cashier finally asked me what my name was. She eventually goes over to the receipt orders and gives it to the line prep member. It was not until 6:20pm that I finally have the food in hand. I should have just lined up in the first place; this completely defeated the purpose of ordering ahead to \"skip\" the line. I laughed when I looked back at my e-mail confirmation and saw \"guaranteed\" time of 6:00pm. \n\nDuring my 20 minute wait, I saw several customers walking back because they were missing items. I also saw complaints about the store being out of napkins, ice, and hot sauce. It was looked like a tornado came through parts of it, just messy all around. And throughout my interaction with the staff, never got a sorry or apology. Just hurriedly handed me my bag and off to the next person. It didn't seem like a manager was around either. No one to direct things, just a bunch of drones working non-stop (to their credit). \n\nI'll never come back to this location.

Not knowing, I asked the guy next to me \"Is there something wrong?\" He said: \"Sometime it's ok, sometimes not\".\nI was about to find out what he meant. I checked the bag to insure everything was there. I looked at the labels saying \"Two Tacos....\" on the little aluminum trays. Problem was when we got home there was only one (more like a half of a taco) taco in the containers.\nThe queso was filled with flour and pretty inedible. The guacamole and chips were good. So dinner tonight was some chips and quacamole. \nAll for only $23.\nTerrible!\nIf you want anything resembling edible Mexican food, Chipotle isn't for you."},

Every bad review that is left here is absolutely correct! From the cleanliness or lack there of to the lying manager and sorry customer service. I placed an online order for pickup at 12:15.

After waiting while on a 30 minute lunch break, I came back to work to the wrong order. Label was correct but what was inside was not! I ordered a veggie bowl and received chicken and if you don't eat meat you know how upsetting this can be. I called the store literally 30 times, no one answered. By this time my lunch break is over, I haven't eaten and no one cares enough about their customers to answer the phone. Because no one answered, I drove back to the store. When I returned to the zoo of a restaurant, the manager told me he could not do a refund because I placed my order online.. LIES! He told me to call 1800CHIPOTLE to receive a refund.. LIES! 1-800-CHI-POTL is a hotline for catering and they direct any issues you have to the store. There is no customer service number to speak to a live person. When I came back in the store to confront them of their lies, suddenly they can refund my money through email from said manager Rebecca that never even came to the front to speak to me, she kept sending some nervous cashier that could barely keep up her line. I was told I would receive a refund in 3-5 days with no documentation of this being true, but if I don't.. guess who'll be back."},

If you are truly in desperate need of Tex mex cuisine and you find yourself stuck at this location you will most definitely walk out wishing you just went to the Chic Fila across the parking lot. The food is passable as edible but what makes this location the worst chipotle in existence is the atrocious customer service.

If you ever wanted to pay for your food and be given an attitude for coming in and inconveniencing the workers from their daily lives then by all means please come in to this location. The manager sits back and watches this disrespect cross his line and fails to lift a finger to reprimand his unruly employees.

I recently started a new job in the area and decided to come for lunch bc they don't have a Chipotle where I'm from. I understand it was very busy bc of the lunch rush, but the employees at this location were just awful. Especially the cashier working at the time, she was extremely rude to both me and my friend and was even arguing with my friend about her meal bc of a mistake by the fault of her own coworkers. She was throwing our food around and literally threw the bags at us. Never greeted us, never told us to have a good day, just a horrible attitude. She should not be working at the register if she's going to be acting like that towards paying customers. I tried to get her name but she wasn't wearing a name tag.

The cashiers asked us if we were ready, and after we said not yet, they were very patient and didn't give us a single stare (you know the one I'm talking about). \n\nWhen I went to order, I got the Pick Two with a Grilled Cheese and Broccoli Cheddar soup. For my side, I asked if I would be able to get a bagel instead of chips or a baguette, and they said yes! They even gave me green onion & chive shmear for FREE! I'm fairly certain that's not SOP, but I was elated to get that kind of customer service from them, and that merits a five star all by itself.\n\nCombine that with a comfortable seating area and free wi-fi (seems to be becoming standard for most places) and a good hearty THREE PART meal for less than $7, and I walked out of there a full and happy camper, most definitely headed back there soon!"},

It would appear to me that on a Saturday morning the management team would ensure, based off sales reports, that enough souffl\u00e9s are be available. I probably would have tried something else if he would have suggested it but with his poor customer service I had no choice but to leave. This is not the first time they run out of souffl\u00e9s at this location on a Saturday morning. So, Einstein Bagels won my business today.

My first complaint about this restaurant is it's poor layout. You pay for your food at the counter, and they hand you a cup for the fountain drink/tea pitchers, and then the fountain is NOWHERE to be seen! I seriously looked all over and couldn't find it. 5 minutes later, I figured out it was way down on the other end of the store, behind a wall. Who the hell designed that? I also saw many other customers looking around, just as confused as I was. And not once did either of the teenagers working behind the counter notice or respond to our expressions of confusion and offer help.\n\nMy second beef with this place is that they have the offering of an apple as a side to your entree. Which is fine, and tempting, especially if you have guilt about just eating a sandwich and cheese soup. But when I went to pick up my plate from the counter, there was just a whole apple that had been plunked down on my plate, waiting to roll off onto the ground during the walk back to the table. It may sound juvenile to ask a restaurant to cut an apple for you, but the only utensil I had was a butter knife. Uhh, okay? Once I finally dug into my apple the old-fashioned way, I found out it was mealy and warm inside. Yuck!\n\nI still stand by the fact that their pastries and breakfast offerings are good, but for my money, the lunch/dinner menu is over priced and underwhelming."},

At least he's taking care of me before he goes anywhere else.\n\n Soup:  I wanted some New England clam chowder, but they only serve that on Friday's. Bummer! So I asked my son to pick me up cream of chicken & wild rice and one more soup, whatever they think is good.  Their suggestion was French onion and he said that it's the most popular one. The soup came with a sour dough bread bowl. He told me to dump all the soup in the bread bowl then eat it from the bowl, so I did. I don't care much for the bread bowl though. I think my son brought it for me just to try it out. The soup itself was very good but as soon as I got to the bread part that started to melt in with the soup it gave me the sourdough taste, which I don't like.\n\nCall me weird but I don't like French onion soup that much. There was just soup and onion. Duh, its onion soup what do you expect right? The soup reminded me of brown gravy spice mix that you put in brown gravy sauce for mash potatoes or beef tips. It's good but not great.\n \nBakery: I was craving desert, so I asked my son to pick me up a pastry ring from Panera. His friend works there and he brought home a pastry ring one day and said that it was free because they were going to throw it away anyway. It's nice to know that they bake everything fresh every day. Good advertising in a way I think. Because of that free pastry ring I now know about Panera and want to try some more of their pastries. It's a fluted ring, baked with cherry, apple and cheese filling. Mm, mm, mmh good! I like it because it is a small size, not the big size that you normally see everywhere else. I can eat all three fillings without feeling guilty about it.\n\nI can't wait for that new one on 183 and Lake Line by Mattress Firm to open up. I'm a fan of some of their soups and the baked goods from Panera so far. : )"},

It wouldn't register when the cashier swiped it.  She said I couldn't use my gift card.  \n\nYes, I was not able to use a valid Panera gift card at Panera.  She tried to brush me aside by saying, it doesn't work.  You can't use it.  How do you want to pay? This has never happened to me before.  I asked why, etc...  noting that this was a really bad business practice.  She insisted- I couldn't use the Giftcard to pay for my meal.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I have a Giftcard for your restaurant.  We just proved it has $ on it.  Why can't I use it?  She insists, \"No, it won't work.  It won't swipe.  You can't use it.\"  \n\nAs this was happening, the line behind me grew and grew.  The cashier said she was the manager and I needed to contact the company about the gift card.  I asked again- does the Panera Giftcard have money on it? \"Yes,\" she said.  I couldn't believe the lack of customer service here.  \n\nAfter quite a bit of time going back and forth, the line is growing.  She ends up comping my meal.  So, I sit down and wait.  I wait and wait.  Nothing.  No meal comes.  Finally, I get up to ask what's going on. The staff had never received my order.  I had waited so long by that time.  It was an exhausting experience.  Finally my food came out.  All in all it was a super terrible experience.  When you have a gift card, it's embarrassing to have it \"not work\" for no reason at all.  Worse, it's awful for the cashier/manager to insist the gift card has money on it, but not be able to use it. Panera, get it right next time!"},

My wife and I discovered it when we were living in Missouri in the 90's and it was called the St. Louis Bread Company. I'm writing this review because the company has noticeably started growing downhill, at least at this Austin location. I think the employees simply don't care anymore. It's funny, but the food itself seems just fine. The quality is still there as far as I can tell. However, the place is just filthy and completely disorganized. Here's the list of things I noticed. \n\nI arrived around 7pm and the place had almost no customers. Nobody in line. There were about 6 self-serve kiosks and about 6 registers. None of the kiosks had any pagers to take to your table and nobody was stationed at the registers. I stood in front of a register for a few minutes before somebody noticed me, and of course they had to go get somebody else to help me. In the meantime I noticed some of the bakery items were just plopped down without much work to remove cooking sheets or arrange in front of the proper price tags and descriptions. \n\nAfter I ordered (clearly interrupting the cashier's dinner break) I made my way over to the coffee. One pot was labeled \"freshly brewed at 12pm\" -- 7 hours old. Trash was everywhere on the floor and I literally could not find one clean table in the place. The trash can was full and the employees had covered up the trash \"hole\" with a dirty upside-down plate. There was a small bucket with rags floating in the water on top of the trash can, presumably to wipe down the tables. I cleaned off my own table and drank my coffee and ate a pastry. Again, food was fine. The employees here seemed to be just hanging out with 1-2 folks really trying to slowly get the place back together. In the hour I was there, I saw one guy carrying a huge stack of dirty plates to be washed and the same guy running a vacuum. Everybody else seemed to be just out of sight in the kitchen hanging out and talking. I literally overheard a guy joking, \"if you could just do all my work for me then I can just hang out and do nothing all day.\"  I had to order some takeout for my daughter before I left, and I was again waiting for a long time before somebody noticed me. The one kid who was cleaning the restaurant and restocking the drink station with lids saw me and took my order. Another employee walked by and made no attempt to help him (poor guy who was helping me was holding 3 bags of lids and struggling to balance them while taking my order).  \n\nI grabbed some butter packets out of a tub by the coffee, and there was trash in it!  On my way out, I noticed the vestibule was full of leaves and trash, and the doormat was rolled up and pushed to the side. (Maybe somebody was going to sweep and lost interest?). I really did NOT want to attempt the rest room based on how dirty the rest of the place was. I'm glad I skipped it. \n\nIt's really sad when a place like this with decent food just completely stops caring about taking care of the restaurant. I 100% blame the management for not training the employees and giving them a sense of pride in providing a clean, welcome environment for the customers. \n\nThis is not the only Panera location in Austin where I've noticed this problem. Lakeline and Bee Cave Galleria are not much better. Shout out to Cedar Park 1431 for looking good and having attentive employees. \n\nI hope Panera will visit the Austin locations and work on turning it back around. Just keep it clean and maybe attempt to tidy up and look presentable!  I don't want to see cardboard boxes of back stock piled up everywhere. Wipe down surfaces and pick up trash, for pete's sake. If it doesn't turn around, I'll find another restaurant for coffee and pastries."},

I wish that they would have said something to me about it, so I could have told them to make me something else or put it on something besides white bread, instead of assuming that that was going to be ok with me. I did call and spoke the manager, he handled it ok. I am not sure if he understand how annoyed I was that I stood right there and he didn't say anything about them being out of the bread, but anyway... I went in a couple of days later and the day manager was super sweet and handled the whole situation great! So I am very happy about that.\n\nI am not going to let that incident stop me from going back. I love this place. I really enjoy that the calories are posted right next to the item on the menu and the scones (I don't wanna know the calories to) are so good!\n\nI had a bagel there and it was super great too!

One time we were  waiting at our table for our order for over 25 minutes. I went  up to the counter and could see our order on the screen in red counting up from the time we made our order. Other new, green tickets were being delivered left and right. The person behind the counter never acknowledged me standing there until I literally grabbed her attention to get a manager. They had somehow skipped our order over. The bus boy delivering the trays I guess didn't have the sense to notice our ticket on the board for an excessive amount of time. The manager made it up by comping us for our meal. He was very nice. This was the worst experience we had. Other times the food is fresh and delicious. Compared to other Panera's I've been to, this place is ran very poorly. With it's perfect location and amount of traffic this store receives, I would think Panera would keep more of an eye on this store. It's a consistent mess.

Showed him my receipt and he apologized. He began making another sandwich. Then he realized they were out of bacon. I watched several guys walking around with clipboards as a line began to form up front. One of the guys with clipboards noticed the line and yelled to the back for another girl. Actually yelled and sounded really angry and rude. He then blew by me and asked if I had been helped. I knew this fool saw me waiting along time already. All of a sudden he is going to yell and act like he is doing something by asking if I have been helped. You know I have been helped. You know I have been waiting a long time. Meanwhile Izzy is running around trying to figure out how to get some bacon. I feel sorry for all the people that just walked in the door. So it's prime time busy breakfast time....there are no eggs, no bacon....one guy that seemed brand new making everything, a manager that has no idea how to make a good decision, step-in and take over getting the customers helped and I waited 37 minutes for two breakfast sandwiches. One was cold with egg shells and bacon bits. See my photo of my $4.18 cent sandwich. Cold eggs with egg shells....yum...no salt or pepper. I was also 10 minutes late to work.

And now, their breakfast.....I LOVE the mini souffles, soft fluffy egg supported in a buttery, crispy croissant, with 4 different choices to pick from (spinach artichoke, sausage & gouda, 4 cheese, & spinach & bacon) ...wow.  And their bagels...especially the asiago bagel and the cinnamon crunch bagel are delicious!! \n\nI would not recommend the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, its a little pricey for what you end up getting, and your sammy is more egg than anything else in it. Which brings me to the final part of my review.  Although, their food quality is a 5 star all the way, some of their items are very pricey for what you get.  I for one, would not mind paying $6-7 for a b-fast sammy if you made it with equal amounts of ingredients...otherwise, I had to remove half the egg to even get a taste of the bacon.  But, don't let that turn you off this place, I havent tried their pasta dishes yet, but its on my list.  This is only my personal opinion and recommendations.  Its a great lunch place to grab something and run back to work too!!"},

My history with Panera was limited to a breakfast pastry several months ago, so my first time ordering a meal.\n\nIt was pretty busy when we arrived, but the staff was efficient at getting the customers moved through.  The gentlemen that served me was absolutely top notch!  His station was at the far end of the counter--furthest from the end of the line.  He came around to where I could see him and motioned that he was ready to assist me.  Professionalism in spades.  Well dressed, tidy, presentable, great manner---didn't feel like I was eating at a fast food place at all.  I was incredibly impressed.  Their drink station isn't readily visible from the counter, so he made a point of giving us a heads up about where it was.  The same staff member brought our food to us, and we got to enjoy his professional service again.  Seriously, folks.  Food service members everywhere could take lessons.\n\nI ordered the Roasted Turkey and Cranberry Flatbread.  Wow.  Granted, I don't eat out very often at all, but this was absolutely heavenly!  It was so good, I want to go back and get it again.\n\nTwo thumbs up!  Awesome service.  Awesome food."},

We both tasted it all, and we both concluded, it was all terrible.\n\nThe french onion soup was sweet with little flavor.  Chicken noodle, almost no flavor and what little there was, didn't taste like chicken.  Two ounces of chicken salad on the sandwich was flavorless.  And the worst item, the steak and cheese sandwich had a funny taste, and unfortunately, a strange after taste that lingered.  The best part of the sandwich, there was little of it.  I would guess maybe 3 or 4 ounces.\n\nWhat a rip."},

I love that Panera is trying to remove junk (artificial ingredients, colors, etc.) from its food, and I'd happily support that, but the food is just no good anymore. \n\nAdmittedly, I haven't visited Panera in a long time, but today I bought a meal, fountain drink and coffee mug \"for here\" for $17.60. I'm serious. Almost $20 for a meal, drink, and coffee. At Panera. For that, I could've gone next door to Whole Foods for significantly more, and significantly better quality food. Food that I could've EATEN. \n\nI ordered the Wonton Broth bowl for the first time today, and I couldn't eat more than 1 bite. For that matter, I couldn't stand having it at the table with me, the smell of it was just atrocious. -- And I love asian -and asian-inspired- foods. I've never met an asian food I couldn't at least power through, if I paid for it.  --- And I've had fish head soup.\n\nAnyways. I dropped the uneaten bowl off in the disposal area and went to get something else, since I was still hungry. I ended up just getting a chocolate croissant. I joked with the girl at the register about how I was not AT ALL a fan of the wonton soup, so I was just going to get dessert. Despite my protests, she went to tell the manager...and he walked straight past me without a word. I paid $9 for a bowl I couldn't even stand the smell of. The manager didn't care. I bought my croissant (another $2.79) and went back to my seat.\n\nThen I went to get a mug of coffee to drink with my croissant. Wouldn't you know it, both urns left out for the afternoon are empty. I asked for some Decaf to be made, and they made some.\n\nAnyways, this felt like a total waste of $20 and I will not be returning. For that much I can get 2 really good meals, drinks and dessert from Whole foods next door."},

You know what it is.  It's no worse or better than any other Panera I've been to, and I've been to many Paneras, spanning six states.  Yes, it's a chain, but that doesn't automatically make it a lesser establishment, not necessarily.\n\nPanera was originally called St. Louis Bread Company (and still is, if you go to StL), so to me it's sort of a little slice of home, when I feel like escaping Austin but can't.  \"Corporate\" or \"chain\" are often used as pejoratives, even by me, but I give Panera a free pass just for being so reliably good.\n\nAssuming you're well acquainted with Panera, I don't know what you need to hear about this particular location except the layout of the interior.  It's a pretty good-size Panera, with two walls completely covered in panel windows facing 360 and the parking lot, north and west (so you know which way the sunlight is going to come in).  Lots of tables, and the more lounge-like chairs are off in the far corner, kind of tucked away for good reading.  Usually, I just bring my laptop, order a bagel and coffee, and watch the sunset.\n\nIf you've never been to a Panera anywhere, then it's about time you did, and I'll tell you what to expect:\n\nHot paninis or cold sandwiches, various soups, and salads.  Sides include a baguette, apple, or chips (I think a spear pickle is included with all of them).  Lots of bagels and cream cheeses to choose from, cookies, scones, stuff like that.  And, of course, the bread.  You can order a loaf of any kind of bread to go, which makes a great item to bring to a party.  You can also order soup... in a bowl MADE OF bread, and how many places can say that?\n\nThey have great pumpkin spice lattes in the fall, but other than that I usually just stick to the black coffee, so I don't know about their other drinks.  The iced green tea is good.\n\nReally, I'd give it 5 stars except I'm sometimes disappointed in their coffee, and this goes for all locations.  It's like a plague upon all Panera franchises.  They're good about brewing fresh pots every 90 minutes or so, but sometimes it's burned.  And honestly, I'm tired of the same choices: light, dark, or hazelnut?  Yes, there is a fourth option, which is the decaf, but I never touch the stuff.  The very idea of decaffeinated coffee is an abomination, an affront to nature.  Why it isn't outlawed is beyond my comprehension.\n\nBut seriously, why hazelnut?  I mean, don't get me wrong.  It's a good flavor.  But the only flavored grounds they ever have?  No experimentation with other flavors?  What about cinnamon, snickerdoodle, or chocolate?  What about Highlander Grog?!  No, it's always the same old hazelnut.  For the most part, the same goes for the rest of the menu: they found something that worked, and haven't changed it in years.\n\nThe other thing that holds back a five-star rating is the ambient music.  All Paneras have this kind of cheap, generic jazz playing at all times, which is part of the vibe.  It's upbeat, and it's okay, but you're never going to be treated to some really, really good jazz.  Panera jazz is its own type of jazz.  It's all part of the predictable Panera package.\n\nThat's a chain restaurant for you.  It's a two-edged sword.  On one hand, it's reliable, you always know what to expect, and if that's what you're in the mood for, you can COUNT on it, without disappointment.  On the other hand, the three choices of coffee do get old, and the palate eventually gets bored and wants to wander and discover new things.  Panera's hazelnut is good, though, for what it is.\n\nYour coffee experience will vary depending on who brewed it and when it was brewed, but they helpfully display the exact time it was brewed.  I seem to have the worst luck, because lately every time I go it's already cooled down too much even as soon as it comes out of the thermos.  That, I hate.  Their coffee simply isn't good enough to be likable when it approaches room temperature, I'm sorry.\n\nIf you have more of a sweet tooth, I used to order and recommend the frozen caramel espresso.  It's quite a rush, and it tastes like happy.\n\nFor soups, I have to recommend French Onion.  It also comes with Gruyere and Asiago croutons, which add a lot to the flavor.  Order it with a baguette, so you can tear it into little pieces for dipping.  Mmm-mmmm.\n\nFor the paninis, I tend to go with the Smokehouse Turkey.  Very good on a cold day. \n\nReally, everything on the menu is practically a clinically-proven combination of complementary flavors.  But my favorite item on the entire menu is the Bacon Turkey Bravo sandwich!  Smoked turkey breast, bacon, smoked Gouda, lettuce, tomatoes, and their signature dressing, all on my favorite bread, Tomato Basil.  The bread alone is flavorful enough to be a meal, but the decision to go with smoked Gouda for the cheese was a stroke of genius.  My favorite sandwich ever.\n\nJust don't get your hopes up about the coffee."},

Although the pastries I had at that time were great, I'd say my lunch at this new North Austin location was nothing more than average. I had a roast beef sandwich. It had cheddar, onion and a creamy horseradish sauce on it. The bread was the best part of the sandwich. The roast beef was way too overdone for my liking. I prefer it when there's at least some pink to a roast beef sandwich; theirs had none.\n\nI'd also prefer to have at least one or two other choices for sides with my sandwich. The only option was potato chips, which I don't really like. I would have preferred pasta salad, potato salad or fruit...none of these options were available.\n\nMy wife had a chicken and fuji apple salad. I think we were both under the impression the salad would have apple pieces in it....To be fair, it does have apple pieces, but those pieces are in the form of dehydrated apple chips, the kind you'd find in a batch of trail mix. The taste was really strange. The chicken was really good though. Too bad that was the only part of the salad I liked.\n\nLastly, I had a caramel nut brownie. The brownie was dry and the flavor was average at best.\n\nI would have given this place only 2 stars if I didn't feel fairly confident I can find something else there that I'll like. My mother-in-law loves the pannini sandwich that has turkey and artichokes on it, so I'll try that next time.\n\nIf it sucks next time, I won't go there again."},

The soups are darn good, the tea has a good taste to it, and there are a lot of options. The pastries are pretty good, although I rarely partake. The bagels are good, too. I rarely order anything else so I can't speak to the sandwiches that folks seem to complain about on these reviews. \n\nAlso - the staff are really friendly and are obviously trained to please customers. Paige gets props for being consistently friendly and on the ball and is a credit to the restaurant. I know that fast-casual restaurant jobs at chain restaurants are not long term careers necessarily, so I appreciate the consistent attempts to be pleasant and helpful by all of the staff even during the lunch rush. \n\nI'm glad there are a few Paneras in Austin."},

However, upon lifting up some of the cheese, voila!, there was some steak.  So we paid $7 for a sandwich that consisted of bread and cheese, with a tiny bit of steak thrown in.\nThis store treats customers like we are there to serve them, not the other way around.

The only thing they had in the middle of the corn, blonds, and occasional cow was the university, and 4 bars.  For real.  I was understandably eager to skip town ASAP, but when I got to Austin, I couldn't find soup. Why would I be trying to find soup right?  That's dumb!  But I like a good, wholesome, hearty and flavorful soup, and that's the one other thing Indiana had: Panera.  Of course, it was freezing a good part of the year, so you sometimes wanted to pour a bowl of soup into your pants *and* eat soup, then have ice cream, then eat a pastry, because all there was to do there was eat and grow like 6 pant sizes.\n\nI digress.  Austin is at soup temperature most times, but regardless I have a special place in my heart for the chicken noodle and french onion soups at Panera.  Their other vegetarian soups are also happiness-making, and the service at this location is great.  There's usually a clump of folks against the wall, trying to decide what to order before looking ready for one of the like 20 people fielding orders at the cash registers.  The Mediterranean sandwich is yummadelicious and I'd sooner get any of the sandwiches than a salad to go with my soup in the Pick 2 special. The salads can be smallish.\n\nI know, I know. You got me. Look, it's a chain. Okay. Anyway, whatever; I'm already getting frustrated. I don't want to argue with you. But I haven't seen a local spot offer such variety in soups and sandwiches for me to pick from. Until that happens, I'm going to hit up that free wifi and grab a nice warm bowl of soup to eat under the AC.  Afternoon delight."},

I haven't been to a Panera for about 10 years, and I wasn't expecting much. The atmosphere (especially behind the counter) is wonderful, however. I really enjoyed seeing (and smelling) all the fresh breads and pastries upon entering. There's nothing like a whiff of fresh bread at lunch time....\n\nI ordered the tuna salad and some chips. The tuna was made with quality ingredients and came with tomato, lettuce and onion. It was of much higher quality than say.. a Subway. The bread was excellent - a type of wheat - that you could tell was amazingly fresh. It was still warm even!  The chips were generic potato chips, but were not as unhealthy as Lay's or something like that. The sandwich and chips were about $7.50.\n\nThe ambiance was nice enough for a sandwich shop. The colors were warm and earthy, and the seating was comfortable. It wasn't too loud but the atmosphere wasn't dead either. There's always a bit of hustle and bustle behind the counter because they're baking. I enjoy watching this process and seeing this activity. It's much more enjoyable than... again, a Subway where all you see is some old bread sitting in a warming oven.\n\nThe staff at the restaurant was also very pleasant. The manager came by to ask how everything was, and it was great, and he moved on.  The woman behind the counter was nice enough as well. She put the drink my friend ordered on my tab since all I wanted was water - saved us a buck or so. I really appreciated that.\n\nI have absolutely no complaints about this location, and I expect we'll be back!"},

She then asked if there's anything else she could do before she walked away. \nAbout two seconds after I was done with my sandwich one of the managers walked by and asked how everything was and if you could take my empty plate. \nSeems that everything they are doing is what people should be doing on every day basis but sadly in Austin, it sometimes can be hard to find great customer service."},

And no, the quality does NOT justify the cost. Worst of all, they no longer allow bagel substitution as a side item! What a bummer. \n\nQuantity is the other problem. Their bowls look big but they never fill it up all the way. I've always liked their Napa Almond Chicken Salad sandwich but it's just a small scoop of chicken salad placed on a regular square slice of white bread. I got their Chicken Tortellini Alfredo in large a few weeks ago and I honestly thought they gave me the small portion by mistake (I even brought it back to the counter). It's just sad.\n\nOh, and do yourself a favor and DO NOT get their new \"broth bowls\". They're a joke. I tried their Soba Noodle Bowl with Chicken and it was the smallest portion of noodle I've ever had. Again, deceptively large bowl but unfortunately, it's only about 1/4 filled. As for the taste, it's just... regular soup. It's so normal that I can't think of an adjective to describe it. Don't be fooled, there's nothing Japanese about it. It's actually kind of insulting that they've added soba into this \"broth\". And guess what, it cost $13 with the chicken add-on!!!\n\nSo yeah, I'm out.

This location packages their sandwiches with a pickle and that's not listed anywhere on the ordering system / menu, and the pickle's juice seeps all over the butcher paper in which they wrap their product, thus ruining the lovely bread.

I'd never eaten there before, but I'd spied it several times on various trips to the worthless Sprint store upstairs.  Last Thursday, a friend wanted to try it, so I met her and some other people.\n\nWe got there early, so the lines weren't very long yet, but you'd think they were with how exhausted and annoyed the counter boy acted.  Everything he said to me was spoken in a bored, sing-songy tone.  I ordered the Get Two with a roast beef sammich (sub mayo for horseradish, no onions), and potato soup.  I also got a choice of apple or potato chips, and I chose the apple.  I completely forgot to order a drink while I was standing there, but Counter Boy advised me that water cups were available at the drink station.  That's when the little cheapskate in me came out.  I filled my water cup with iced tea and went to town.\n\nIt didn't take long for my order to come out.  And you could be deceased but still wake up to get your order because they give you one of those annoying coaster pagers to alert you.  Those things are super loud and irritating when they're sitting on a wooden table.  I'd almost rather hear fingernails on a chalkboard.  Or even Yoko Ono singing show tunes.\n\nAnyway, I thought the half sammich was Smurf small, which made me realize that ordering a full sammich for around $6-7 wouldn't be worth it.  As it was, I think I paid about $8 for my grub, which was fair.\n\nNote:  *Cheddar cheese does not taste good with roast beef.  Swiss is much better.*  And the romaine lettuce didn't taste right in combination with the other ingredients.  The bread was too soft for my taste; I prefer a crunch to mine, so the sammich was altogether forgettable.  The soup and apple, however, were decent.  But it's extremely hard to mess up an apple.  The soup is what saved this place from my two-star wrath.  Well, that and my easily-stolen iced tea.\n\nThere's a wafer-thin possibility I might go back and try some other soup, but I'll never again mess about with their sammiches.  Them things ain't even passable; they're pass-byable."},

I asked the person over the counter about the lettuce and he said they were out of emerald greens. I said okay and then asked about my soda cup. He pointed me to the man at the register, where I had to wait for someone to finish ordering before I could ask him if I could just get a cup since they were behind the register. After filling it up, I walked past a half-eaten salad bowl. I realized there was no way they could be out of all greens so I went to the counter and asked if they had literally any type of lettuce. The same man as before started listing different types of lettuce that they had like spinach, romaine, etc. I'm not sure why he didn't tell me that to begin with, I would've taken anything. After he gave me a cup of romaine, I got home and realized I got some sort of cheesy bread instead of sourdough. And I ordered sourdough online because they are ALWAYS out of croissants. For how overpriced Panera is, you'd think they would get your order right and not be out of half their items, including 90% of the bakery. First and last time going to this Panera location.

The sandwich is filling without any heaviness afterwards.  They also had their fresh bagels and fresh pastries to go available which are made overnight at the restaurant. There were less than 10 other diners in the restaurant at any given time during my lunchtime Friday visit. It's good to have a decent place to get something to eat where we can sit down even when it is a nothing special chain restaurant.

You need a moist sandwich, so you won't choke! It also had small bits of celery and seedless grapes! It had the perfect taste of sweetness with no salt or acidity.  The tomatoes were even good, and I hate tomatoes! It was served between 2 slices of Sesame Semolina Bread,  that was also great!  You can order a whole or half of a sandwich, I had the whole with a side of chips. I need to come back and try another sandwich, and for you healthy people,  the chicken they use has no antibiotics!

I used to frequent the Somerville Avenue one just outside Porter Square.  The staff here are pretty friendly and I don't have any complaints about them.\n\nI love how they remodeled the place creating the much needed more space for patrons. I do miss however the community book and boardgame section they used to have. Always busy, but the line never stays long, even on the way to work there's time to stop in for a latte.\n\nThe downside of course is being a corporation where everything has to be uniform, I wish they had better food options, and didn't have to shout the orders to each other. The staff can be too fast sometimes and I tell one person my order and when I get to the register (four of five people ahead of me) they already put it in and I wanted to add money to my gift carf first and use the gift card (free soy milk! and points towards free drink people). Not a big deal they can just delete the order, add the money, redo the order. It just happens pretty much all the time. Slow down and enojy the aroma of coffee :-P\n\nAs someone who used to work in a chain coffee shop I can appreciate how stress free, how clean, and how smooth this store is run. Its why I keep coming back again and again. Not really their fault, but I wish the city and the owners of Somerville Courtyard (where they are located) did a better job of enforcing the private area policy. I can't sit there and play guitar with an open case to collect change and sell cds, but the vagrants panhandle incessantly at the outdoor seating area which is usually a pigsty. I recommend staying inside where its cleaner and quieter."},

There are the window seats for people watching, the window seats with the shades pulled down, the long library-esque table with computer outlets and great lighting for the person who wants to feel like they are in a library and a coffee shop at the same time, the big brown comfortable chairs for the old person or the hipster.

They're soft, even though the entire point of frying a cake donut is to make them crispy, and the glaze has begun to slough off and soak into the insipid cake. \n\nIt's not a horrendous donut, but it's also not worth $1.50.

I live just around the corner from this location and love coming here every day for my morning coffee or mid-day pick-me-up. They're super consistent and relatively fast, even when there's a decent-sized line. Even when they are busy though, I've never felt rushed by them or picked up hurried, anxious, overwhelmed (/weeded) vibe from them. As someone that's worked in the restaurant/bar industry for years I totally appreciate this balance been sustaining a hustle and preserving a relaxed and welcoming vibe- it's not always easy to do, and definitely not overly common- so it's very much appreciated when I encounter it (and this Starbucks does this consistently!). \n\nI also totally recommend this location to anyone with allergies or dietary restrictions. I've gone most of my life without either of these concerns, but very recently developed some medical issues that have kept me on a somewhat restrictive diet- not necessarily allergies in the classical sense, but certain foods/ingredients I can't have (or can only have in certain limited amounts) without feeling really crappy for the rest of the day. I would almost prefer if they were allergies because it would be easier to explain, for instance, why I can't have cream in my coffee but a particular type of cheese in my lunch is OK (lactose vs. lactic acid in case you're wondering the difference...) and my requests may generally be taken more seriously if I could quickly and simply explain them using a term most people understand. So, sometimes to simplify things (or to ensure my order is treated with the same importance as an allergy) I say it's allergy, but this is a little tricky because some things I CAN eat but have been given strict limits of HOW MUCH I should consume in a day to keep my levels under control (so if I haven't had any sugar at all one day, I may order something that has small amounts in it, but the next day perhaps I've already reached my daily limit and need to make sure I don't have any MORE- if I've said I'm allergic now I just seem like that picky eater that devalues the seriousness of allergies and contributes to them being generally not treated as urgently as they should be. That's a long and boring explanation that I rarely have the time (or the care) to fully divulge, especially when I'm ordering my first coffee of the morning and am only half-awake. Regardless, and without ever having to go into any detail whatsoever about why, at this Starbucks I've never had any issues and have felt totally assured they take my restrictions seriously. I've never noticed a single eye roll or sigh or any annoyance whatsoever really in these situations. And when I'm ordering my first coffee of the morning I love going where I know it's OK that Im still only half awake and I don't need to be overly vigilant that everything is correct in my order... because I know they have it under control... Once again, they are always super professional. So thank you!"},

This Starbucks is the only one that has offered to get me a different drink when I tried a new flavor that I didn't quite enjoy. When I bought a cookie, the cashier asked if I wanted it  warmed up. They don't mind (that I can see) that I forget my drink order by the time I get up front. There have been some visible eye rolls and very audible groans in other Boston Starbucks locations. And the banter. They got good banter. I've actually written to corporate about their staff.. but I have no idea if that actually matters. \n\nOn Wednesdays, there's an open mic that I believe is still hosted by local musician Max G.  Have never been in, but it seems like there's a good crowd when I walk by. Also, by the by, lots of seating. By the counter there are actually desks with lamps that  I see being used all the time. But I guess that's my one peeve. It's generally crowded. Recently I sat down and chatted with a friend at normal tone and I noticed some student giving me the evil eye.  I'm sorry.. were you studying? I'll just go ahead and use my inside  voice because I forgot Starbucks doubled as a library.  Go back to the dorm. Just kidding. Sort of.

Our weekend PJ trips are relaxed, give us time to read the papers, people watch, and catch up with neighbors.

Alas, I'm no Howard Schultz and can't give my business advice out with much cred. However, I'll still keep on coming back for the comfy chairs, the fireplace, the local vibe, and the great staff at this Sbux. \n\nSo if you see a disheveled couple poring over their NyTimes and Boston Globes with our reusable mugs (of course), that's this starbucks fan celebrating the wonders of caffeine, great music, and stellar people watching."},

Did you know that Starbuks stuff comes wrapped in cellophane like a twinkie?  I recommend you go across the road to diesel cafe if you want something that is fresh and local.\n\nStaff:  Cool.  No complaints, no compliments.  They used to do a trivia question on Thursdays for a free coffee, but not any more.  *sigh.\n\nSeating:  Get it if you can.  Always packed and you may feel out of place if are not pecking away at a computer.\n\nTemp:  Cold in the summer and can get drafty in the winter.  They are busy and have two doors, so the wind can occasionally chill you while you work at the big centre table.

Since starting my illustrious career in consulting, and ongoing work as a grad student, I've found this Starbucks' atmosphere to be conducive to gettin' stuff done. Bonus: it's a very short walk from my apartment! I recommend bringing earplugs or headphones if you don't want to hear the random phone conversation, Norah Jones on the speakers, or the sounds of coffee machines. \n\nI have found the staff to be extremely chill and friendly, which is pretty cool, considering they must deal with all kinds of people. \n\nMy only qualm lies with the relative shortage of power outlets during peak hours (usually between 11 and 5). However, if I know I'll be heading there to do work, I'll fully charge my computer and then bring my charger in case i get lucky and score an outlet. \n\nSo in short: free wi-fi, unlimited access to productivity-inducing caffeine, and friendly staff?

And I could say I do spend a lot of money there. But I guess 50X it's a charm. There's not one single time I go to this location after or even at 3pm that they still have Blonde coffee. I was told from Lexington location in Bedford ( btw- the best starbucks in MA, the staff is Amazing and so caring, I could name all of them) anyway they told me they were supposed to offer a fresh blonde, at Davis that NEVER happened and when I tried once, they told me\nNO. But they do have time to chat, make jokes with themselves. Then I tried a coffee cake, again, they were out, and not for the first time. Give me a break, if you are a busy location order more. Please care a little about your clients. So I tried the half&half. Forget it it's empty and NO ONE cared to check. And the whole area it's dirty. Is this the place I am supposed to open my coffee and expose to the area? It is dirtier than outside and messy. Why do I keep trying this location? Honestly?! Because I believe in the brand and I thought they would hire good people that cares, that would take care of the business and clients and I always believe, that next time I am there. It would be different. A change for a second. A Starbucks the way it's supposed to be. I am wrong! Somethings don't change. Starbucks at Davis Square is a proof of that. Diesel caf\u00e9 cross street and Davis Square Donuts down the road, have more personality."},

The bagel was hard and chewy with way too many sesame seeds for my liking.

Back in Houston I lived right around the corner so naturally livin' the Dunkin coffee life became the norm.\n\nBut this particular Dunkin' is a cut above the rest in my opinion.  Now granted you can argue about who's \"donuts are better\" or which snobby coffee spot around town has better cold brew n stuff like that but nobody can argue about the value you get for the dollar here at this Dunkin'.\n\nFor one, it's one of the locations that offers free refills on any hot or iced coffee(does not include lattes).  So you can drink and drink and drink until it's time to go!  And that's any flavor, any specialty.  Who else does that around here?\n\nAlso, you can walk in with just about any coffee mug and they will fill it with hot coffee for .99 cents!  Most other Dunkin' places require you to have their branded mugs to even offer you promo pricing like that but here they are very generous and let you bring your own container.  So if you have a big thermos and want it filled to the brim with their fresh hot joe, just bring it in clean and they will fill it.\n\nThey do things like this because they want you to come back over and over again.  I'm a regular there, so I walk in and they know just how I like my stuff.  \n\nNow I've read a few complaints and reviews from other yelpers that are quick to slap a place down with a low score for drinks that weren't made right or weren't satisfied with the product.  I had a talk about this with their staff and management and while they do their best to make everything  perfectly, they welcome feedback from their customers and if you are not satisfied with your beverage or food item, kindly tell the manager on duty or one of the staff and they will make it right.  It's not a hard concept to grasp.  And if you don't have time to address it, come back later or call and speak to someone and I assure you they will do whatever it takes to make it right.  \n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving it a perfect score is because during rush hour peak times I often see just 2 people working.  And I understand the cost of labor vs revenue/profit I think it's almost always worth paying an extra employee to be there to help when customer satisfaction is on the line.  Nobody likes to wait 15-20 mins to order coffee and donuts when they are pressed for time.\n\nThe seasoned veteran staff here is warm and friendly too.  Love this place.\n\nAnd if you like regular iced coffee with cream and real sugar, ask them to melt the sugar with a bit of hot coffee first.  That way it dissolves and mixes into the coffee instead of sucking up sugar crystals at the bottom!"},

A couple of the girls are really nice and pay great attention to getting your order to you quickly, correctly, and with a smile. Unfortunately, one woman in particular always leaves me feeling like I should be apologizing for interrupting her day by asking for a cup of coffee. I get that this probably isn't her dream job, but glaring at everyone who walks through the door isn't exactly helping her win friends and influence people.\n\nIn the end, I recognize that you do get what you pay for, and I am happy to be able to get a fast, inexpensive cup of coffee close to work, even if the curved design of the drive-thru is a bit tight for those of us who dare to drive an SUV in Austin."},

The egg-spinach-sausage mix itself isn't the best ever but for a \"healthy\" item, it was pretty darn good.

On my early-afternoon visit, there was initially no music, then they turned on KISS FM (mostly innocuous--not good, by any stretch--pop music; in fact, you'll look forward to the ads). Still, this is a big improvement over their previous \"all crap country all the time\" fare (I'm not ragging on good country, just crap country), which was mandated by the (apparently hostile, redneck) owner, according to staff I asked on my last visit, more than a year ago. But my thinking is, this place is in Austin and should play local music stations, such as KGSR and KUT, or local artists' music. In any case, bring your earbuds.\nCOFFEE\nThe \"mocha latte\" (if you say so, DD) was way to sweet, tasted nothing like coffee, and was suffocated in whipped cream that was, in turn, drowned in syrup. The Dunkin' Donuts coffee (I had a regular after I finished the sweet thing) is freaking amazing, as always. (I grew up in the Northeast, where it rules, and rightly so.) Sitting there for more than 2 hours, I happened to stumble upon Happy Hour (3pm-5pm), when coffee is half off, making a large coffee just 80 cents. I buy their beans to brew coffee at home. There is no drip coffee in the USA that even approaches the high quality of DD's. I know folks who love the burnt Starbucks stuff, so I guess it's always a matter of taste, but if I wanted to lick an ashtray, I'd go lick an ashtray, not pay $2 for Starbucks drip. (I prefer Starbucks mochas, though.)\nDOUGHNUTS\nMy chocolate \"kreme\"-filled doughnut was fresh and bliss-inducing. Why the quotes? I love these doughnuts, and/but it cracks me up that they call the filling \"kreme\"; I guess the misspelling is their way of admitting that, while there may be dairy in it, it's just creamy-looking; in fact, though, it's whipped chocolate frosting. I love it, I love it. And *only* 300 calories. Next time I guess I should *walk* here from my place (10+ miles away). (I neglected to ask if Happy Hour applies to doughnuts, too.) Krispy Kreme is down the road, but I can't understand how anyone could rate their doughnuts (much less their coffee, which is the worst ever!) as better; I feel vaguely sick after just one bite of those glaze-saturated KK donuts. But, hey, there's room for two doughnut chains, right?\nSTAFF\nQuietly friendly but unsmiling, slow, and confused staff at 1pm (and one was a manager!); a quicker, if also unsmiling, server at 3pm. I wasn't offered/given a receipt for either purchase, which is irritating. You'd think that for as long as I was sitting there a manager would have taken a moment to ask how everything was, but no. The music volume went up a lot after 3:30, which was quite annoying and inconsiderate since I was obviously working and the music was clearly just for the staff's enjoyment. It gave me the impression that eating in is discouraged. When a worker came out to clean up and empty the trashcans, she made a racket that suggested she was either oblivious to my presence (after serving me only 15 minutes before) or doesn't know how to make customers feel welcome.\nWIRELESS\nFree wifi, but only 2 outlets (close to each other) and a 2-hour limit that I couldn't seem to get around: a self-defeating policy for them since there were plenty of empty tables and the longer I sit, the more coffee I buy. While I was there, only twice was another table occupied, and only briefly. There are no homes nearby so no way the neighborhood could be using their wifi signal to excess, so what's the point of this time limit? I was probably the only person all day to use the wifi there. (Krispy Kreme, btw, imposes no such limit.)\nA GREEN POINT\nThey add the cream for you behind the counter instead of handing out tiny plastic creamers (Hint: give them a color, or your coffee may be too light).\nONE BIG BAD\nIt seems illiterates write their email ads and Web site content.\nBATHROOM\nGenerally clean, but there was hair in the sink, and I guess they've never heard of a toilet brush."},

I have learned to accept Starbucks so we date now and I have broken up with DD's but when I go up North I will cheat on Starbucks. I guess the benefit of no more DD's is I don't drink coffee as much.

I don't know what it is, but this woman and the whole show just gets under my skin. The past two seasons, it seems like a never-ending cycle of dawdling, distractions, and delusions, and the women who watch it keep feeding into it this. Meanwhile, someone with serious health problems who started with a goal in mind is not solving the real problem at hand. I have been watching Ruby from the start. Her personal story of weight loss was very inspiring at first, and it seemed like she had the right tools to reach her goals. But seriously, spray tans, Spanx, and a new hairdo are not going to help her lose weight and regain her health. That WAS the original goal, right?. Right?! \n\nWhat's my point?!\n\nIronically, after posting this incredibly rare rant on both my Facebook and one of Ruby's blog posts, I was craving doughnuts.\n\nSo a couple nights ago, I went to my old standby, Dunkin Donuts. Old standby meaning if I ever really ate doughnuts to begin with, I'd go here. I know they're anathema to my lifestyle. But hey--I exercise, I eat right most days, and I've maintained my weight loss. Plus, Madonna used to work at a Dunkin Donuts, so, that's kind of cool.\n\nAs a kid, I was allowed to indulge in Dunkin on occasion, usually on Sundays after church. This was probably because I never weighed more than 99 lbs. until I was a sophomore in highschool, and my parents were desperate for me to fill out. Sometimes I think I'd sell my soul to be able to bottle and sell that kind of adolescent metabolism to adults, but Satan's really been lowballing me lately on that deal and frankly, he's starting to get on my nerves. Don't *even* get me started on the fame and fortune negotiations. It's a mess.\n\nI remember those \"chocolate kremes\" they used to sell, which were basically globs of chocolate cake frosting in a light dough covered in powdered sugar. Those were my favorite; I rarely deviated from buying any other kind but these for most of my life. And at any function at church or school that featured a doughnut platter, it was pretty much a standing order to stay the hell away from the chocolate kremes until Nathan had had his fill; to do otherwise would bring disastrous results.\n\nFresh off my Ruby tirade, I passed by a rather judgmental group of overweight teenagers who stared me down as I walked in the door. What is with people staring these days? Don't people have any manners? Inside, I've got to say, I was a little shocked. \n\nApparently this place had undergone one hell of a remodel since I'd last been in. Where were the ratty booths? Bistro tables? Modern designs on the wall? Four flat screen TVs behind the counter? The place was like a doughnut infused hybrid of a Starbucks and a sports bar with a splash of pink and orange paint. \n\nI got my bearings and found myself missing the old aesthetic for nostalgia's sake. That passed pretty quickly when I realized I don't actually come her ever, so I didn't actually care. Of course, I ended up behind a woman who was taking her sweet time. I glanced over to see what she was up to, and at first I thought she was paying for her doughnuts with several gift cards. Right after I imagined she must have had the most twisted bridal registry in history, the lightbulb went off that she was *purchasing* a buttload of gift cards. Her snooty teenage daughter kept flouncing around and bumping into me, making a point to walk by me half a dozen times for no reason at all and irritate me, while her mother meticulously chose different card designs. Charming family.\n\nFinally, after Mommy checks out and that girl inexplicably bumps into my arm for a final time, I get to the counter and hear \"What'll you have, sweetie?\". I'm always uncomfortable when people my age or younger call me unauthorized terms of endearment. It's a weird mix of condescension and over-familiarity. I asked for (1) chocolate kreme and (1) eclair for the road. And a medium iced coffee to wash it down. Decent coffee, by the way. \n\nHere's the part where 1.) Dunkin will lose me, and 2.) You'll think I'm going to sound like a total weirdo. I know this is a tough economy, but their little tricks of cutting corners is not lost on this consumer. I sliced both doughnuts in half to see if the filling even made it to the center. Dry as a bone. What was once a majestic mountain of frosting had now been reduced to a pathetic pile of pebbles. It was all dough, and not very good dough at that. Even the frosting on top of the eclair looked half-assed. I only ate a bite of each one, then threw them out. \n\nDunkin, where did it go wrong? \n\nNot like it matters to me, I can't eat the stuff anymore. But it goes to show, not even cheap, completely unhealthy baked goods can survive in this economy. \n\nSigh..I guess it all went downhill once Madonna went on to bigger and better things."},

This store, the only one in Austin, is the prototype of the new look. It's fancier inside, and there are a couple of outdoor tables for that view of 183, but it's not a place to linger. \n\nI grew up in Boston, and I'm a long-time fan. They almost killed it for me here, though. Not that many years ago, my sister visited. She went inside their original location for an ice coffee. She came back out with a soda cup. She doesn't drink soft drinks, so I asked why she changed her mind. She hadn't. They were simply out of coffee cups. If you don't appreciate this, imagine if Dominos told you they were out of pizza boxes.\n\nThey've improved their operations dramatically, so they've (almost) become a real store, and now they've gone all 21st century. Well, I think the food took a step backward. I liked the donuts better before. The pizza is worse than what you get frozen at the supermarket. I'm not quite sure why DD and Subway think they should offer pizza. \n\nI don't drink coffee, but nearly all of my friends like their coffee and iced coffee quite a bit.\n\nI go here primarily for the bagels. I am not a fan of Einsteins. DD bagels are bigger and doughier. The selection of flavors is much more limited than Einsteins, though. And management is absolutely terrible at keeping different kinds in stock. They run out of bagels constantly. Hot out of the oven, they're amazingly yummy, but it's a crapshoot whether they'll have any, let alone if they're hot.\n\nWhile the drive-thru is open 24 hours, they reduced the hours for the walk-in service. I used to pop in there for a quick bite at 2:30 AM on many occasions. It was a pleasant alternative to the crowded and slow other options at that hour."},

I also feel their prices are extremely reasonable and competitive.\n\nMy favorite is their cruller, but second is their strawberry filled granulated sugar donut.  This location doesn't sell these donuts regularly, so I have them specially make them for my grandmother.  She misses them, since they were a staple at NYC Dunkin Donuts.\n\nAnd that leads me into customer service. This location has always been willing to make me custom donuts -- that they typically don't offer -- just to please the customer.  They've never once looked annoyed or put out.  In fact, since I'm the only person ordering these specific donuts, they seem prepared for my sporadic orders.  They know me by name!\n\nThey also offer a military discount, which I think is wonderful.\n\nAll in all, this is a great business.  If you enjoy this style of donut, then DD is the place for you.

But it wasn't just that.. there was, an odor to the coffee. Dare I say an odor of meat? How does one make a latte that smells of meat? The world will never know. One sip confirmed that unlike the nasty brews mentioned above, there would be no way to choke this down.\n\nNeedless to say I am now (somewhat) happily working my way through a cup of office sludge will my DD coffee sits at the bottom of my trash can. Also-my bagel was tasty but spread upon with the barest and saddest little layer of cream cheese.. I am rife with disappointment."},

I am a coffee dunker and the stability and absorbency of cake donuts (especially Dunkin Donuts) are far superior to any regular raised donut. In fact, over-glazed donuts are a nuisance: they create a unpermeable layer of sugar that blocks any coffee from soaking in. Preposterous! Fortunately, Dunkin Donuts always offers a good selection of cake donuts. The coffee's not bad either, especially for dunking.\n\n2) Speaking of glaze. Too much of it is bad. No need to have a sugar lacquer, varnish, and sealant to mask the taste of the dough! I like tasting my baked goods. I flick those stupid toppings off of cupcakes, and I usually go for the center piece of the birthday cake.\n\n3) DD is one of the few donut chains to switch to low trans-fat oils-- palm, soybean, etc. It makes a difference in the taste, too (for the better, I think).\n\nHere's what I always order: 1 maple raised, 1 blueberry cake, 1 plain cake, and something I've never tried.\n\nGo to a DD in asia and they have cool flavors like jackfruit, lychee, and mango!"},

The stress of the line creates a rush to move cars quickly I get that, but I can't tell you how frustrating it is as a customer to sit in your car for 20-30 mins for coffee, breakfast sandwiches and donuts only to pull away and find missing items, coffee that tastes absolutely awful and is undrinkable, stale donuts, and cold breakfast sandwiches.\n\nQuality control issues aside, you work with products that folks have serious allergies to and putting the wrong ingredients into your coffee can put people in danger. Most food chains and other Dunkin' locations print stickers on their cups to highlight add-ins/changes - I've had many visits here where they don't use them and my order is usually wrong without them. Please use these stickers and take the time to make sure the orders you put together are correct in the drive-through lane."},

They also were out of apple slices and strawberries for the kids and just through in fries without asking.  They also didn't have the Italian dressing either.

We walked in to a clean restaurant & a short line at the register, & then noted their order kiosks. Of the 3 there, 1 was operating and in use, & the other 2 were not working. Oh well, the line was still short so we didn't wait long to order. Once at the counter, our order was taken by what appeared to be a new employee. He was nice but very slow, & didn't know how to apply our coupon or enter the half chocolate/half vanilla Frosty we wanted & often order without question. Again, no big deal, we weren't in a hurry. Our food was ready fairly quickly, & when we sat our order looked delicious & was accurate - except that the Frosty was vanilla. Not a huge issue, we were pretty hungry & we like vanilla so we just accepted it. The burger & fries were hot, & the Southwest avocado chicken salad was fresh ~ and delicious! Overall this was a positive visit - clean; good service; quick, delicious & (mostly) accurate food - maybe we did get lucky, but I'm happy to return!"},

Waited over 5 minutes, he still hadn't placed his order, was waiting on someone to come on the speaker, 3 more cars pulled behind me.  Waited another 2 minutes before driving around and going inside, three was one person at the counter trying to pick up an order for delivery and was having issues, no one was helping her other than the girl at the counter.  There were 3 people in back, one at the counter, one on the line and one in the drive thru.  2 other emerged from the back, ironically both on their phones, texting or something, they looked like Manager, neither offer any assistance.  Another person had walked in with me from the car behind me and we were both in line waiting another 5 minutes to place an order.  The Delivery girl left after having issues with payment and no help from any manager.  The person who walked in with me placed his order and the girl at the counter walked away, took another 2 minutes to come back and take my order.  It took another 3 minutes for someone to start making my sandwich and which point the girl on the line walked away after pulling out the bun.  Another 2 minutes later she returns from who know where, maybe the bathroom to finish my sandwich.  The Man in front of me got his order promptly, a Big Bag, and finished it by the time I finally got mine.  I had asked twice for my order to go, and it was placed on a tray, I had to remind them again it was to go.  No Napkins, spoon for the chili or any verbal apology for any delay at any point, I wasn't even given a copy of my receipt, probably so I couldn't complain.  I understand if the store is busy, but there was no one in the store other than us 3 and any urgency to live up to the term fast food was never present.  The managers walked from front of house to back of house never offering any help or guidance.

I get there and there's people waiting by the counter waiting for the meals. The workers looked busy and seemed working at a fast pace. I'm there waiting patiently and no attends me. I go to one of the self serve machines to order but it's broken. I go to the front and see maybe a supervisor and this lady is blaming another employee for a wrong order in front of me. I felt bad for the poor guy. Then I get assisted and they take my order. While waiting a guy and his family come to the register to complain they got the wrong order and the employee does not say sorry just says \" what did you guys order? Okay hold on\" and a few minutes later gives them the right order and does not say sorry or anything and tells them \" just throw away the wrong order over there( points to trash)\n\nI get my order and double checked it because everyone here seemed like they were new or just had too much going on at work. I ordered apple pecan salad. They gave me a south type of dressing and not the pomegranate. No pecans, no forks or napkins. I kindly ask the front employee and she just turns around and grabs the right dressing and pecans and says nothing. \n\nJust seemed unprofessional here and a bunch of employees running around doing either a lot or they must be new."},
